Brat Pack is the title of a comic book limited series by Rick Veitch (self-published under the company name King Hell Press). It is a dark satire on superhero sidekicks, influenced partly by the fans' decision to kill off Batman's sidekick Jason Todd, but also built on other long-standing rumors and undercurrents in the history of the superhero genre, prominently commercialism, homosexuality, pedophilia, violence, and the fascist tendencies inherent in superheroes.
</p><p>
The series opens with the villainous Dr Blasphemy calling in to a radio show, where local residents of Slumburg, Pennsylvania (the setting of the story) are venting about their dislike for the teenage super-hero/sidekick Chippy. The pink leather clad sidekick of the gay super-hero Midnight Mink is widely reviled, which leads to Dr Blasphemy challenging the host of the radio program to hold a call-in radio poll. The goal being that, if more people vote for Chippy and his fellow super-hero sidekicks to die, Dr Blasphemy will carry out the will of the people and murder them. Most of the general public, thinking the caller claiming to the villain, call in to vote for the murder of the sidekicks. Once the poll closes, Dr Blasphemy thanks the callers and announces he will carry out their will that evening.
</p><p>
While Blasphemy is holding court on the radiowaves, Chippy is meeting with a local priest where he talks about the cruelty of adult heroes he and his friends sidekick for. Leaving the confessional chamber, a young altar boy named Tony notices the teen hero leave and realizes that his priest knows the heroes. Father Berkeley ignores Tony's request to meet Chippy, stating that being a teenage sidekick is a taxing job.
</p><p>
That evening, Chippy meets up with his fellow sidekicks (Kid Viscious, Luna, and Wild Boy); all of which bully and take turns causing physical harm to the young hero out of a belief of him being a sissy. However, their tormenting of Chippy is interrupted by the arrival of Dr Blasphemy. As he taunts the heroes, there is a sudden explosion, killing three of the heroes and horribly disfiguring Chippy (protected by an accelerated healing power given to him by Midnight Mink). Horribly maimed, Chippy opts to go into hiding as he proclaims himself free from Midnight Mink and the life of a sidekick.
</p><p>
Midnight Mink, the racist Judge Jury, the misandrist Moon Mistress, and the drug addict King Rad meet to discuss the deaths of their sidekicks. The four heroes (known collectively as Black October) have merchandised themselves out to various corporations for vulgar profit; however their contracts state they must have teen sidekicks. They confront Father Berkeley, ordering him to procure four youths from the local community for the four to take on as the new Chippy, Luna, Kid Viscious, and Wild Boy. After they leave, Tony appears having heard everything and offers himself up to become the new Chippy.
</p><p>
The series then focuses on the new Luna, Wild Boy, and Kid Viscious as well as Tony's transition into becoming a super-hero.
</p><p>
Luna II is a spoiled sweet teenage girl named Annie who refuses to have sex with her fellow male classmates, is heavily involved in her local church group, and dotes on her single father. Moon Maiden murders her father and arranges to have her adopted by Moon Maiden.
</p><p>
Kid Viscious II is a lonely rich kid named Richard raised by a widow, who spends her time traveling the globe with her much younger mother. Richard spends his time alone, with only his family's Asian housekeeper and her daughter, to keep him company. Judge Jury murders Richard's mother and frames her boyfriend for the crime, then forces Kid Viscious (who he tortures in order to break him mentally, while pumping him full of steroids and other drugs that cause him to become violent and aggressive 24-7) to murder his housekeeper's daughter when he realizes that he has feelings for the girl.
</p><p>
Wild Boy II is a Hispanic skateboarder named Carlos, whose parents run a successful local grocery store. Unlike the other members of Black October, King Rad simply allows a fire caused by arsonists to go unchecked, killing Wild Boy II's parents and siblings that way rather than murdering them himself. Carlos is then made to indulge in harsh drugs against his will by King Rad, but ultimately starts using them wilingly after a search and rescue mission goes wrong and Carlos is unable to save a young boy from being torn in two.
</p><p>
Tony is raised by a single father, who spends most of his days drunk and forcing Tony to fend for himself for food and basic needs. Midnight Mink murders Tony's father in a staged robbery, then "adopts" Tony.
</p><p>
As the series progress, the four heroes systematically break their young charges mentally and physically through extensive physical abuse (Judge Jury), drug addiction (King Rad), and psychological manipulation (Midnight Mink and Moon Mistress). While they do so, they discuss the missing fifth member of the group: Overman.
</p><p>
A being of pure energy, Overman personally trained Moon Maiden as a hero, was best friends and lovers with Midnight Mink, and who brought the wildcards Judge Jury and King Rad into his orbit to stop a war between the two and Overman and his friends, to allow them to become the sole protectors of Slumburg.
</p><p>
However, Overman became jaded with humans and ultimately left the Earth. However, before he left, Overman discovered that Midnight Mink had contracted AIDS and performed a blood transfusion. The transfusion cured Midnight Mink of AIDS, but also granted him (and anyone who is exposed to his blood in transfusion form) super-human endurance to pain and injury, along with the ability (over time) to heal from any wounds inflicted upon them. When Tony proves himself a worthy replacement as Chippy after several battles, Midnight Mink performs a blood transfusion granting him the same power.
</p><p>
By the end, all four teen heroes are irrevocably broken mentally just like their predecessors: Richard is now a steroid addicted bully, Carlos a drug addict, Annie a completely jaded, teenage slut who performs a coat hanger abortion on herself after having sex with Richard and Carlos. 
</p><p>
Meanwhile Tony finds himself repeatedly visiting Father Berkeley, as he reveals that all three of his fellow sidekicks hate and despise him due to the fact that Midnight Mink, does not overtly abuse and mock Tony like the other heroes do. He further states that he has become irrevocably jaded with the life of a hero and the sociopathic tendencies of Midnight Mink and the other members of Black October. 
</p><p>
Midnight Mink interrupts the confession, as he reveals the full control he has over Tony by having him leave the priest to return home with him. Midnight Mink then tells Father Berkeley that the only reason he doesn't kill him/allows his various sidekicks to vent their anguish and suffering to him, is that Midnight Mink gets off on knowing that the priest can do nothing to save his sidekicks or any of the sidekicks, from the hell that is their lives as super-heroes.
