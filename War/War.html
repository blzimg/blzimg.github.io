The War was a four-issue comic book mini-series, published by Marvel Comics. It was the final publication in Marvel's New Universe line, and resolved a number of unfinished plot-lines, as well as radically changing the New Universe setting.
</p><p>
The War is a sequel to The Pitt and The Draft. The Pitt told of the Black Event, the accidental destruction of Pittsburgh by Ken Connell, wielder of the Star Brand, a vast cosmic energy source. This destruction, mistaken by the U.S. government for a nuclear attack, is blamed on the then-Soviet Union, and led to The Draftâ€”a selective conscription of the New Universe's super-powered Paranormals.
</p><p>
In The War #3, the conflict leads to a general exchange of nuclear missiles, but before the missiles impact, the Star Child, the son of Ken Connell who acquired the Star Brand's vast power while still in the womb, destroys the missiles, but this does not end the conflict; so the Star Child temporarily disables all weapons of war on Earth, and announces his existence and powers to the entire planet, demanding that the fighting cease.
