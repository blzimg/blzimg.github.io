Josh Jaffe, a neurotic family man mid-midlife crisis, buys an online 'smart pill' to increase his focus and jolt him out of his slump. But to Josh's surprise, the pill gives him incredible strength and power-but its cost is that it's extremely addictive. This irreverent and brutally realistic story examines both the mighty highs and humiliating lows of being a real-life superhero.
