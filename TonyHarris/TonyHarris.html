Tony Harris (born 1969) is an American comic book artist, known for his work on series such as Starman, Iron Man, and Ex Machina. He has been nominated for five Eisner Awards. Harris began his comics career in 1989. Initially, he flitted from assignment to assignment and worked on T-shirts and ads to pay the bills during dry spells in his comics work.

He rose to prominence in 1994 with the publication of DC comicsâ€™ Starman. Summarizing his career up to this point, he remarked "When you jump around as a freelancer, it's easy to have your attention span dwindle down to that of a gnat. When I got Starman, I had to buckle down and just get serious about the work." Co-created with James Robinson, Starman led the two to critical acclaim and eventually an Eisner Award for the "Sand and Stars" story arc.
