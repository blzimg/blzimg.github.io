Story: There's a Mountain on Sunset Boulevard!
<p>
A mountain suddenly appears in Los Angeles accompanied by an earthquake, causing massive panic. Ghost Rider, Morbius, and the Werewolf all happen to be in the area and are drawn to the mountain by a mix of curiosity and instinct. Man-Thing also sees the mountain through the time and space defying mists of his Florida swamp and approaches as well. 
</p><p>
The four monsters converge on the mountain and are greeted by Starseed, a large golden man on a golden horse. Starseed explains that in Earth's prehistoric past, his peaceful society inhabited the mountain there until aggressive aliens invaded and used their unfathomable technology to steal the entire mountain into space. 
</p><p>
Over the following millenia, the survivors of Starseed's people evolved and adapted the aliens' technology until Starseed, the very last of his kind, was able to return the mountain to its place of origin, where he hopes to rejoin the human race in peace.
Unfortunately, Morbius and the Werewolf give in to their bloodlust and attack Starseed. Ghost Rider and Man-Thing are sympathetic and want to help him, but due to Man-Thing's inability to communicate, his intentions are misunderstood and Ghost Rider clashes with him as well. 
</p><p>
During the brawl, Morbius and the Werewolf are able to injure Starseed, and as the godlike being is unfamiliar with the sensation of pain, he experiences fear just as the Man-Thing reaches out and touches him, worsening the situation.
</p><p>
In the end, Starseed lies dying, but in his final moments he reveals he had the power to free each of the monsters from their respective curses, making them fully human again. The effect fades along with him, leaving the despondent monsters to depart on their separate ways.
