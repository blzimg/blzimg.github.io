Story: Birthday
<p>
Woodgod is a genetically-engineered sentient life-form who physically resembles a satyr. He was created using cloning techniques by combining human and animal DNA.
</p><p>
Woodgod was created by two scientists, David and Ellen Pace, on their farm in New Mexico. They also had been working with nerve gas for the federal government. When people from the nearby town of Liberty, New Mexico discovered Woodgod they stormed the farm and shot him. 
</p><p>One of the townspeople smashed a canister of the lethal nerve gas within the barn, killing the Paces and everyone in Liberty. When Col. Del Tremens and the U.S. Army came to investigate what happened in Liberty, they found and battled Woodgod (who was immune to the gas) and quarantined the empty town.
