<p>
In the Torpedo's civilian identity, he is Brock Jones, former football star turned bored insurance executive. His wife learns that she is pregnant with their third child.

Stivak, aka Kligger, will figure into The Corporation saga that runs through a number of comics, most prominently in Captain America and the Hulk. In fact, as Kligger, he had already appeared in Kirby's Captain America #213, although i don't think he was yet intended to be the same character. Stivak does seem to be more the plant of a foreign power in this story...
</p><p>
The Torpedo's biggest accomplishment in this issue is causing a meltdown at a nuclear power plant (to be fair, he does prevent the plant from exploding).
