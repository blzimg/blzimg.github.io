Finally, traveling back to the beginning of time, Sise achieves his mystical godhood and comes to realize that his goal to create the universe in his own vision was foolish and so allows the universe to be created as it was, and sends Strange and Mordo back to their own time after both are allowed to witness the creation of the universe. Arriving in their own time, Mordo has been driven completely insane by what he had witnessed.
