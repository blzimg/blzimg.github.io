Story: A Force of Two
<p>
The story starts from the fact that Wonder Man recently found (Avengers #192-193) that one of his factories had been taken over by the Maggia while he was dead, and now he's finding out if that's true of the entire company. 
</p><p>
He's doing so reluctantly, since "ever since I was brought back to life, I've avoided any confrontation with my past, figuring it would be too painful". It's often an effort to remember that Simon Williams used to be the head of a tech company that was a competitor to Stark Industries due to the fact that since his return his civilian scenes have focused on his acting career.
</p><p>
Wonder Man bluffs his way into his old headquarters and finds that it's being run by a mysterious female Director, who employs cartoonish Mafia thugs. Failing to learn anything more that way, Simon seeks out a former employee of his, and learns that he was indeed forced out by the Maggia. The employee was then blacklisted and forced to find employment as a novelty gift store owner.
</p><p>
Inside the factory, Wonder Man encounters the Director and has to fight one of Hydra's Dreadnought robots. The Director escapes and the factory is blown up. The novelty store owner is killed in the explosion.
