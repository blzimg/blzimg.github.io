Star-Lord investigates the ruins on what seems to be an abandon planet. He quickly encounters a hostile environment with electric storms, earthquakes and wild winds, which force him to seek shelter underground inside a root-ball.

Believing he is safe from the space storm outside, the root tentacles begin to attack him as the planet itself is a parasite which feeds off of flesh.
