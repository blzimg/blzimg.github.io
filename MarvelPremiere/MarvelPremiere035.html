Story: The 3-D Man
<p>
Two brothers from Los Angeles, Charles and Hal Chandler have both, in time, been known as the hero 3-D Man. During the 1950's, NASA was just starting to put their first men into orbit. The key to the success of the space program was the XF-13 rocket plane, an experimental aircraft capable of reaching the uppermost atmosphere. When it was time to test this craft, one of the first men chosen to fly it was Charles "Chuck" Chandler.
</p><p>
On Chucks very first test flight of the XF-13 aircraft, he was tailed and later abducted by the alien Skrulls. The Skrulls had been observing planet Earth for ages in the hope of using it's strategic position to gain the advantage in their long-standing war with the alien Kree. So with that in mind, the Skrulls became interested in earth's space exploration programs. The night before Chuck was to make his first test flight of the XF-13, the Skrulls orchestrated a failed kidnapping attempt in which Chuck's brother Hal helped him to escape.
</p><p>
When Chuck ejected from the XF-13, his brother ran over to greet him but just as he drew near, Chuck vanished in a burst of light.
</p><p>
In the belief that his brother had perished, Hal returned to Los Angeles to inform their parents, and the NASA authorities. That night Hal noticed that there was an image of a man imprinted into the lens of his pair of glasses, and that one lens was red and the other green. 
</p><p>
Hal figured out that the images on the lenses of his glasses belonged to none other than that of his brother Chuck, and that they were imprinted there when he vanished in that burst of light. By putting on the pair of glasses and concentrating on the two images while focusing on a flat surface, Hal triggered a dimensional transfer that returned Chuck to this reality but left Hal in a trance-like state.
</p><p>
Although he had foiled many of the Skrulls attempts to take over the planet, alot of his time was spent in another dimension because he could only remain on earth for 3 hours at a time. When Chuck would return to the 2-D dimension of the glasses, Hal could then regain control of his body and emerge from his trance.
