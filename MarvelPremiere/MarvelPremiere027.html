</p>
Drawn to mystical energies emanating from Chandler, California, Satana saves Deborah Hirsch from being burned at the stake for being a witch. This all serves the purposes of Dansker, a being from another dimension that has possessed Hirsch. The entire episode allows Dansker to take control, and try to take out Satana in the hopes of using her for a spell to allow him to cross over into Earth's dimension.
</p><p>
Satana would summon the power of the Basilisk inside her to slay Dansker once he had acquired a limited physical form on Earth. The powerful blast from this spell causes the car that Dansker is driving to explode and drive off a cliff.
