After learning that Harold Meachum has put a bounty on Iron Fist's head, Daniel decides to take the fight to Meachum. However, this proves to be a challenge as Meachum (having had 10 years to prepare for Iron Fist's arrival) had rigged his office building with a number of traps, all of which Iron Fist manages to fight through.

The last trap however is deactivated by a mysterious Ninja who briefly helps Iron Fist.
