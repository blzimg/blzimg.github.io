Continued from Invaders #5.
</p><p>
Bucky storms into a radio station where Patriot is participating in a broadcast and convinces him to offer his airtime so they can put out the word to America's other superheroes to band together and stop the brainwashed Invaders.
</p><p>
The message reaches Red Raven, Thin Man, and Olalla, who were taking over a nazi spy plane, Whizzer and Miss America, who were catching saboteurs, and Blue Diamond, whose anthropology lecture had been ambushed by masked nazi terrorists. When they converge on the radio station, one of the engineers reveals himself as a spy and attempts to suicide-bomb the heroes, but the bomb is frozen to his hand by the late arrival Jack Frost. With everyone assembled, Bucky dubs the team the Liberty Legion and vows for them to fight the Red Skull until they can return the Invaders to their senses.
