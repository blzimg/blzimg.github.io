Story: The Killing of Windeagle
<p>
Windeagle attacks T'Challa at the Wakandan consulate in New York City. Following the attack, T'Challa begins to recall his prior investigation of the death of Monica Lynne's sister in Georgia which somehow had been erased from his memory.
</p><p> 
Windeagle, an agent of the Dragon Circle cult somehow involved in the death, renews his attack on the Black Panther, but is shot and killed by an unknown assailant during the battle.
</p><p>
Continues the Panther vs. the Klan storyline that ran in Jungle Action #19-24 (Nov, Jan 1976) and continued in Black Panther #14, 15 (March, May 1979). It also begins to explain why the storyline was totally dropped and forgotten after the final issue of Jungle Action (#24 in November 1976) and beginning of Jack Kirby's Black Panther title (#1 in January 1977).
