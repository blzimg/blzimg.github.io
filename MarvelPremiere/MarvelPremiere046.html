Story: Stargod
<p>
The Man-Wolf is the hero of prophecy on a world in another dimension (reached via a portal on the Earth's moon). His Colonel John Jameson persona is in control, and he can even "speak", telepathically. He and the rebels are fighting a tyrant called Arisen Tyrk, who has also captured Kristine Saunders, Jameson's girlfriend.
</p><p>
Man-Wolf defeats Tyrk and goes home to earth with Kristine via a portal, which nearly closes before the Man-Wolf goes through. Arisen Tyrk will eventually become Lunatik, sort of. He also flees through the failing portal and his body is split into fragments, which become the Lunatiks. Nothing in this story really informs the zany character in Defenders, beyond his basic look.
