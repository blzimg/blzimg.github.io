Story: The Jack of Hearts
<p>
Jack returns home (mansion), and meets his new butler, Martins, who was handpicked by Tony Stark (and kinda looks like him) and also vetted by SHIELD (in fact, in his next appearance, a SHIELD agent will address him as Major Martins).
</p><p>
When Jack arrives, a letter has already been received at the house. It's from the Corporation, telling him that they still exist and still want his father's "zero fluid". The letter is signed "Hemlock" and his return address is included.
</p><p>
Hemlock is supposed to be an "assassin prime". Jack accepts Hemlock's challenge and shows up to fight. I'm reminded that Jack has a "computer brain". Hemlock dies when he tries uses a laser to cut open Jack of Heart's armor, which causes it to explode.
</p><p>
Jack leaves a bit despondent that he won the fight through basically an accident, and with no more information about the Corporation than he started with.
