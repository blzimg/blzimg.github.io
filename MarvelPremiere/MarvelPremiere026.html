Story: The Games of Raging Gods
<p>
Hercules and his businessman handler, Richard Fenster, approach a raging fire while traveling California's mountain roads. Sensing that the firefighters are losing ground, Herc steps from his car, uproots a giant redwood tree, and effectively defeats the blaze by himself.
</p><p>
He is lauded by the mortals on the scene, then hustled back into the car to try to make a speaking engagement at UCLA on the subject of Greek mythology. But wait, who lurks in the shadows, but his old foe Typhon the Titan, accompanied by the Delphic oracle Cylla! 
</p><p>
We are reminded how Typhon suffered defeat at the hands of the Avengers back in Avengers #'s 49-50. Typhon then relates how he was cast by Zeus into Hades, where he encountered Cylla. She had come there of her own accord after being shunned by Hercules. As they had now a common enemy, they conspired to be free. 
</p><p>
Cylla worked a little magic, and Typhon was able to ascend to Olympus to reclaim his battle axe from the Promethean flame. Yet it was so hot when he grasped it that it became bonded to his hand. Enraged, he lashed out, piercing the clouds that separate Olympus and Earth, and sending the Promethean flame earthbound. Hence, the fire Hercules happened by and extinguished.
