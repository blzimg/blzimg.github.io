Continuing the noble pursuit of taking funny old pictures and putting funny words on top of them! We've asked some of the funniest writers in comics today to look at the romance comics of yesteryear and put in some new dialogue that'll make us laugh! Unfortunately, the funniest writers were busy, so we had to settle on these guys. Hey, you get what you pay for!
