The Vinyl Underground is a comic book series published by the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics, created and written by Si Spencer with art by Simon Gane. The title debuted in October 2007 and ran for twelve issues before its cancellation in September 2008.
</p><p>
Unveiled at the San Diego ComiCon in 2007 by Vertigo's Karen Berger as "'yet another' good Vertigo book about England," The Vinyl Underground is described by its author, Si Spencer as "a love-hate story about the streets of London that shaped its characters, and that shaped its author." 
</p><p>
Spencer, who writes for TV series EastEndersâ€”credits London, his "adopted home now for ten years," with "two thousand years of violence which have shaped its streets," as well as fiction set within them. Spencer writes in the Vertigo column "On the Ledge" that the city "constantly barg[ed] into the story uninvited," informing in the process the "right narrative voice" for the Vinyl Underground series.
