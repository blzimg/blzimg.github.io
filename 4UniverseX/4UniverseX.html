Mr. Fantastic, Adam Warlock, Alicia Masters, and the Thing discuss plans to reverse the mutation effect all over the Earth. The Thing is sent to retrieve the son of Adam Warlock (Mar-Vell) from Namor. Mar-Vell reveals that Earth's dead heroes are still fighting battles in the land of the dead, believing they are alive. There, Johnny Storm convinces Dr. Doom they are indeed dead, and together they send the Invisible Woman back to life. X-51 and Galactus review the history of the Fantastic Four.
