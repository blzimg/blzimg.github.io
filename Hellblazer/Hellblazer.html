Hellblazer (also known as John Constantine, Hellblazer) is an American contemporary horror comic book series, originally published by DC Comics, and subsequently by the Vertigo imprint since March 1993 when the imprint was introduced. Its central character is the streetwise magician John Constantine, who was created by Alan Moore and Stephen R. Bissette, and first appeared as a supporting character in The Saga of the Swamp Thing #37 (June 1985), during that creative team's run on that title.

Hellblazer had been published continuously since January 1988, and was Vertigo's longest running title, the only remaining publication from the imprint's launch. In 2013, the series concluded with issue 300, and has been replaced by a DC Universe title, Constantine. It was then relaunched in 2016 with the title The Hellblazer as part of "DC Universe Rebirth", restoring the character to his original cast, tone and setting. Well known for its political and social commentary, the series has spawned a film adaptation, television show, novels, and multiple spin-offs and crossovers.

The series was the longest-running and one of the most successful titles of DC's Vertigo imprint, and was the stepping stone to many British writers. Notable writers who have contributed to the series include Jamie Delano, Garth Ennis, Paul Jenkins, Warren Ellis, Grant Morrison, Neil Gaiman, Brian Azzarello, Mike Carey, Andy Diggle, and Peter Milligan. Hellblazer was one of the first modern occult detective fiction works and heavily influenced the genre to come.
