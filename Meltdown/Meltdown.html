Havok and Wolverine, X-Men both, are on vacation in Mexico, apparently having challenged each other to go the entire vacation without using their powers. First to lose buys the beer for the rest of the trip. But even not using his claws, Wolverine manages to end up in trouble. A band of thugs show up at their motel room looking for a fight so Havok and Wolverine take off in the first car they see. Unfortunately, it belongs to a woman in the parking lot. To keep her from getting shot by the guns the thugs are firing, they tell her to hop in and they run.
</p><p>
Wouldn’t you know it, the woman who owns the car is in on a scam to kidnap Havok and kill Wolverine. Unfortunately, Wolverine’s mutant healing ability is stronger than the fifteen darts filled with bubonic plague he is shot up with and, despite their intentions, he makes it.
</p><p>
Havok is only shot with one dart and he makes it, too, but when he wakes up, finds himself in a hospital with a woman who says she nursed him back to heath. In reality, she’s working for the enemy, a mysterious Soviet agent named Meltdown who wants the use of Havok’s power, his ability to “convert solar energy to plasma”, thereby giving himself infinite strength and power to conquer the world.
</p><p>
But Wolverine isn’t going to let his pal and team mate go that easily, so he sets about doing what he does best, which is kicking ass and not taking names cuz he’s too busy kicking ass.
</p><p>
Their trials take them out of Mexico, into the Carpathian Mountains for some reason, and finally into India where the pair reunite and battle the vicious Meltdown in the middle of a nuclear reactor that’s about three seconds away from melting down itself.
