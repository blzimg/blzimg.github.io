Blankets is an autobiographical graphic novel by Craig Thompson. As a coming-of-age autobiography, the book tells the story of Thompson's childhood in an Evangelical Christian family, his first love, and his early adulthood. The book was widely acclaimed, with Time magazine ranking it #1 in its 2003 Best Comics list, and #8 in its Best Comics of the Decade.

In late 1999, Thompson began work on the graphic novel, which was published three and a half years later in 2003. Thompson produced the books as a way of coming out to his parents about no longer being a Christian.
