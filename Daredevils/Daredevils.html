The Daredevils was a comics magazine and anthology published by Marvel UK in 1983. Aimed for a more sophisticated audience than typical light superhero adventures, The Daredevils featured Captain Britain stories by Alan Moore and Alan Davis, as well as new Night Raven text stories, and reprints of Frank Miller's Daredevil stories. In addition to these regular features, it also included some Spider-Man stories, occasional one-off comic stories, and a variety of text articles.

The title lasted eleven issues before merging with The Mighty World of Marvel.
