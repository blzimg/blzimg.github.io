Pick up where you left off with Dark Horse's exciting 16-issue superhero explosion Comics' Greatest World, and find out more about the most mysterious and powerful hero of them all, Vortex! 
</p><p>
In the first of the Vortex monthly stories, "From the Maelstrom," the military personnel of Nevada's top-secret Army post, Cinnabar Flats, face off with a force beyond their experience -- perhaps beyond their imagination. They bring out the best firepower available... but will they end up simple casualties in a battle of the big-time between Vortex and the Seekers who have tracked him across the galaxy?
