Series: 38 issues 1969 - 1976<br>
Publisher: Marvel<br>

In the late 1960s, Marvel branched out from their niche as the leading super-hero comic publisher to start new titles in mystery, westerns, humor, and romance. Our Love Story was a product of this period and an effort to use the then-formidable cultural power of the “mighty Marvel style” to breathe life into the most conventional and turgid comics genre, love and romance, which by the late 1960s was completely played out and encrusted in cliches.

Our Love Story was nothing if not stylish, with up-to-the-minute romance stories told in the breezy Marvel fashion and illustrated by bullpen luminaries like Johnny Romita, Gene Colan, and Vince Colletta. The high-water mark of the series is the impossibly scarce issue #5, featuring the classic story “My Heart Broke…in Hollywood,” Jim Steranko’s tour de force kiss-off to Marvel and comic book work in general.
