Scrappy is a cartoon character created by Dick Huemer in 1931 for Charles Mintz's Screen Gems Studio (distributed by Columbia Pictures). A little round-headed boy, Scrappy often found himself involved in off-beat neighborhood adventures. Usually paired with his little brother Oopy (originally Vontzy), Scrappy also had an on-again, off-again girlfriend named Margy and a Scotty dog named Yippy. In later shorts the annoying little girl Brat and pesky pet Petey Parrot also appeared.

Richard Huemer (1898-1979) was an American animator in the Golden Age of Animation that created Scrappy for Mintz Studios. He joined the Fleischer Studio in 1923 where he developed the Koko the Clown character. Later he moved to Hollywood and worked as an animator and director for the Charles Mintz studio.

The Winkler Studio became known as the Mintz Studio after he took over in 1929. Mintz would experience his biggest success in Scrappy, which would continue production after Mintz died. In 1933, Mintz's studio (Winkler Pictures) became known as Screen Gems.
