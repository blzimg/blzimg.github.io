The world's super heroes mysteriously disappear from Earth and then reappear in a giant arena in outer space. The Grandmaster and Death herself have decided to use the Earth's super heroes as pawns in a game they are playing against one another. If the Grandmaster wins the game, his brother, the Collector, will be restored to life. Both the Grandmaster and Death select 12 heroes to fight for their side and find the four pieces of the golden globe of life. Whichever team finds the most pieces wins!
