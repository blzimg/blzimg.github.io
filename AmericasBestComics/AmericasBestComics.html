America's Best Comics is a Golden Age comics series that ran for 31 issues from February 1942 - July 1949. The series was published by Nedor Comics. Nedor Comics was the comic book line of publisher Ned Pines, who also published pulp magazines under a variety of company names (primarily Standard, Better and Thrilling) that he also used for the comics. In business from 1939 to 1956, Nedor was a prolific publisher during the Golden Age of comic books.

Its best-known character is The Black Terror. In June of 1949, all comics were moved to the "Standard Comics" line, with a "Standard Comics" flag-like cover logo (all titles previously had no publisher logo, which was the norm at the time). In 1956, Standard ended and only two were continued by Pines Comics. What connection this new company had with Ned Pines and his company is unclear.These comics are in the public domain and various publishers and creators have used them since.

Publisher Bill Black used many of the characters during the 1980s under the imprint Americomics (later shortened to AC Comics). Many of the female heroes are members of the AC Comics superhero team Femforce. Most recently, Nedor Comics' characters have appeared in writer Alan Moore's comic book Tom Strong and its spin-off Terra Obscura.
