Perhaps the deadliest threat Batman has ever faced is back in town. And this time, the Predator's not alone! On Earth to show his son the thrill of the hunt, an older champion brings the "boy" to Gotham City where the younger Predator will "cut his teeth" on Robin. 
</p><p>
Now Batman must find and neutralize the threat while trying to keep Robin out of the path of these deadly aliens. To counter them, they may have to make a pact with another deadly enemy: Mr. Freeze!
