<p>
The book that coined the phrase Graphic Novel, it contains four stories: A Contract with God, The Street Singer, The Super, Cookalein. Following the author's introduction, "A Tenement in the Bronx", the book contains four stories set in a tenement building. They derive in part from Eisner's personal memories growing up in a tenement in the Bronx.
</p><p>
1. A Contract with God<br>
In Russia, the young, deeply religious Hasidic Jew Frimme Hersh carves a contract with God on a stone tablet to live a life of good deeds; he attributes to it his later success in life. He moves to New York, into a tenement building at 55 Dropsie Avenue, and lives a simple life devoted to God. He adopts an infant girl, Rachele, who is abandoned on his doorstep. When she dies of a sudden illness, Hersh is infuriated, and accuses God of violating their contract. 
</p><p>
He abandons his faith, shaves his beard, and lives a life as a miserly businessman in a penthouse with a gentile mistress. He illicitly uses a synagogue's bonds that were entrusted to him to buy the tenement building in which he had lived when poor. He becomes dissatisfied with his new way of life, and decides that he needs a new contract with God to fill the emptiness he feels. He has a group of rabbis draw up a new contract, but when he returns home with it, his heart fails and he dies. A boy, Shloime, finds Hersh's old contract, and signs his own name to it.

2. The Street Singer<br>
Marta Maria, an aging opera singer, tries to seduce a young man, Eddie, whom she finds singing in the alleys between tenement buildings. She had given up her own singing career for an alcoholic husband; she hopes to get back into show business as mentor to Eddie, and gives him money for clothes. He buys whiskey instead and returns to his pregnant wife, who herself had given up on show business for him and whom he abuses. He hopes to take advantage of Maria and build an actual singing career, but is unable to find the aging diva againâ€”he does not know her address, and the tenement buildings appear all the same to him.
</p><p>
Eisner based the story on memories of an unemployed man who made the rounds of tenements singing popular songs or off-key operatic operas for spare change. Eisner remembered throwing the street singer coins on occasion, and considered he was able to immortalize his story in The Street Singer.

3. The Super<br>
Those who live in the tenement at 55 Dropsie Avenue fear and mistrust their antisemitic superintendent, Mr. Scuggs. The tenant Mrs. Farfell's young niece Rosie goes down to his apartment and offers him a peek at her panties for a nickel. After receiving the nickel she poisons Scuggs' dog and only companion, Hugo, and steals Scuggs's money. He corners her in an alley, where the tenants spot him and call the police, accusing him of trying to molest a minor. Before the police can break into his apartment to arrest him, he shoots himself, embracing Hugo's body.
</p><p>
Eisner wrote that he based the superintendent on the mysterious but threatening custodian of his boyhood tenement. Eisner added a page to the 2006 edition in which a Super Wanted sign is posted on the tenement building, following the original conclusion of Rosie counting her stolen money.

4. Cookalein<br>
Cookalein is a story of tenants of 55 Dropsie Avenue vacationing in the country.
</p><p>
To be alone with his mistress, a man named Sam sends his wife and children away to Silver Lake, Woodridge, New York, a lake in the Catskill Mountains, where they stay at a cookalein (Yiddish: kochalayn, cook alone, a place for boarders with access to a kitchen).
</p><p>
A clothing cutter named Benny and a secretary named Goldie are staying at an expensive hotel near the cookalein, both hoping to find someone rich to marry; they mistake each other for a wealthy target, and when they discover this, Benny rapes Goldie. Herbie, an intern Goldie had earlier turned down, takes her into his care, and Benny goes on to court an heiress. An older woman seduces Sam's fifteen-year-old son Willie at the cookalein; they are discovered by her husband who, after beating her, makes love to her in front of the boy.
</p><p>
At the end of the summer, the vacationers return to Dropsie Avenue. Goldie and Herbie are engaged, and Benny believes he will be marrying into the diamond business. Willie is affected by his experiences, but does not express them, and his family plan to leave the tenement. For the 2006 edition Eisner added an extra page of Willie from a rear-view perspective, looking out from his balcony.
</p><p>
Cookalein was the most overtly autobiographical of the stories. Eisner used the real names of his family members: his parents Sam and Fannie, his brother Petey, and himself, Willie. Eisner called Cookalein an honest account of his coming of age that was a combination of invention and recall.
