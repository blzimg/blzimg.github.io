Son of M is a 2006 American comic book limited series, a follow-up to Marvel Comics' 2005 "House of M" storyline, starring the depowered Quicksilver. Quicksilver was one of the many mutants to lose his powers as part of the Decimation, for which he was partially responsible.

Pietro struggles to deal with life as an ordinary human, and desperately uses a beacon to attempt to contact the Inhumans. An attempt to stop an anti-mutant gang killing a mutant with an organism growing on his stomach goes badly, until Spider-Man intervenes, after which he confronts Pietro (angry with the fact that he still has memories of being married to Gwen Stacy and having a child together from the House of M reality), which leads to Pietro jumping off a roof, seriously injuring himself.

Crystal, who Pietro had tried to contact earlier, teleports in with Lockjaw, to find her ex-husband lying hurt, and blames Spider-Man. Pietro wakes and interrupts Spider-Man's attempted explanation to tell Crystal that he had jumped off the roof. Crystal teleports him to the Inhumans' home for medical attention, believing he had become suicidal upon the loss of his powers and unaware of his true connection to the events.
