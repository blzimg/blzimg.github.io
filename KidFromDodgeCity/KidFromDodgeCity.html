Growing up Jess Wayne was born under a western sky out on the prairies before his family settled down in Dodge City. From there young Jess learned to ride a horse before he could walk. Growing up as a boy he was taught by soldiers, pioneers and Native Americans. As a young boy he was inspired by his mother to practice medicine after mending the leg of a wounded deer. His father, Whiplash Wayne was the sheriff of Dodge City and when Jess grew old enough his father taught him how to shoot and Jess became a master of the cross-draw. Whiplash hoped that his son would follow in his footsteps and become sheriff when he retired. Whiplash and his wife always argued over their son's future but eventually decided to let the boy make up his own mind.

On his 21st birthday, Jess got medical books from his mother and his fathers six shooters and badge. It was then that Jess informed his father that he was going to study medicine not become a sheriff, wanting to save lives not end them. This upset his father to no end, but Whirlwind eventually accepted his son's decision. However as fate would have it the day that Jess was leaving town to go easy his father clashed with outlaw Beef Benson and his gang. Jess witnessed his father getting shot in the back as the gang fled. With his father paralysed from the waist down and now confined to a wheelchair, Jess finally agrees to become the sheriff and bring Benson and his gang to justice.

After explaining to his mother what happened and the promise he made to his father, Jess was proud when his mother handed him his father's guns and told him to avenge Whiplash. Over the passing days Jess used his skills as a tracker to track the gang, often stoping to ask people for information along the way. Eventually one day he caught up with the gang. Confronting them, Jess proved he was the superior gunfighter by shooting the guns out of the outlaw's hands and taking them prisoner. Leaving town Jess Wayne would be forever known as the Kid From Dodge City...
