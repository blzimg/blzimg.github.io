A hard-hitting crime/espionage series goes behind the veil of the U.S. Intelligence community. When the Losers, once an elite U.S. Special Forces Unit, stumbled onto the C.I.A.'s dirty little secret, their refusal to play along got them murdered...or so the C.I.A. thought. Now the Losers are back, and out for payback against the organization that stabbed them in the back.
