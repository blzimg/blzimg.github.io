Quasar (Wendell Vaughn) was invited to attend a Charter meeting. However, when he arrived he found their ship had been massacred and he was soon framed for the attack. Others were called in to apprehend him but some of the others were convinced he was innocent. The Star Masters proved Quasar was innocent and agreed to act as a peacekeeping force for the Charter.
