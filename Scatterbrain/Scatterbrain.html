Some people like comics! Other people really like peaches. But if your teeth hurt, you can't always eat them. The peaches, I mean. Did you ever put toast in a toaster, only to have a slice mysteriously disappear? Or put socks in a dryer, only to have one of them vanish? New scientific evidence points to a magical world meant only for socks and toast! Here, they live happily, away from prying eyes.

Have you ever heard the phrase, "swimmer's body"? It's a bit misleading, really. It's meant to describe a lean, honed physique. Have you ever actually seen swimmers up close? They are plump, and extremely wrinkled from the water.

Batman gets carjacked, Spider-Man finds out he's the Green Goblin, and Spawn kills Street Fighter. But over here in the idiot-fueled land of Scatterbrain, Scarlett O'Hara preaches compassion as our international men of mystery battle for the title of World's Greatest Cartoonist. We got two Spanish geniuses, we got dinosaurs, we got space men, we got the otherwise indescribable Pip and Norton.
