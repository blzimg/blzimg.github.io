In a post-apocalyptic setting in a future where humanity has been subjugated by a computer dictator called International Destiny Machine, or IDM, a young, sensuous woman named Misty has become one of the few humans who refuses to surrender to the mechanical tyrant.

The Adventures of Misty first appeared in the early 1970s in an erotic graphic album titled “Misty,” and then a decade later in a second graphic novel called “Misty and the Sun Jewel.” In 1991 she returned, 1970s costume and slang intact, in this series from Forbidden Fruit for 12 issues.
