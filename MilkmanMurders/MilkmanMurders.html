The infamous 2005 mini-series returns in an all-new deluxe hardcover edition! The horror of suburban life explodes in an orgy of mythic violence -- and mild-mannered housewife, Barbara Vale, finds herself at its dark epicenter! And when you meet her family, you'll understand why. This slice of Americana is brought to you by the twisted minds of Joe Casey and the legendary Steve Parkhouse.
