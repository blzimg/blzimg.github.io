Based on the classic Atari game! When a terrifying creature from beyond the stars attacks his planet, Dale's journey begins. But he is not out to save his world. It is already too late for that. As the lone survivor, the only thing he wants is revenge! Writer Max Bemis (Worst X-Man Ever, Foolkiller) and artist Eoin Marron (Sons of Anarchy Redwood Original) bring you a tale of survival and vengeance like you've never seen before.

Centipede is the kind of comic that will take you by surprise multiple times for a multiple number of reasons. You wouldn’t initially expect a licensed comic based on an 8-bit arcade game from nearly 40 years ago to be particularly compelling, and yet that’s exactly what Centipede is. After the titular centipede lays waste to the population of an entire planet, one man is left to hunt the creature and reflect on what all it means to be the last of one’s civilization.

Centipede makes a point of exploring all of the ways in which nostalgia can profoundly impact a person’s well-being, but the series cleverly plays with how we as a society have come to think of nostalgia within the specific context of comic books and nerd culture. Nostalgia, here, isn’t just for video games and entertainment, but for the everyday experiences one has as a person living in the world.
