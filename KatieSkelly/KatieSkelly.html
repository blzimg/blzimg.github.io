Katie Skelly is an American comics artist and illustrator. She is best known for her graphic novels My Pretty Vampire, Operation Margarine and Nurse Nurse. She began drawing her own comics in high school, and after graduating from college, Skelly began her science fiction-themed, Barbarella-inspired series Nurse, Nurse. She received a B. A. in Art History from Syracuse University and followed it with graduate coursework at City College of New York.
</p><p>
In 2017 Fantagraphics Books published Skelly's first hardcover graphic novel My Pretty Vampire, notable for its "dramatic colors" and "sense of mercurial motion". Inspired by the Italian horror films of Dario Argento and the early work of comics illustrator Jean-Claude Forest, the story follows a young vampire who escapes captivity by her brother to discover herself through surreal, sensual and often violent adventures in the modern world.
</p><p>
Skelly's other works include Operation Margarine (2014, Adhouse Books), for which she was awarded the inaugural Emerging Artist Prize at the Cartoon Crossroads Columbus Festival in 2015; The Agency (2018, Fantagraphics Underground); and illustrations for the Alex de Campi penned Twisted Romance: Heartbreak Incorporated (2018, Image Comics), which received a 2019 Eisner Awards nomination for best anthology.
</p><p>
Among her early works, Skelly self-published Nurse Nurse in chapter-sized installments until Sparkplug Comics founder Dylan Williams offered to publish the collected issues. Nurse Nurse was one of the last pieces Williams finished publishing before he died in 2011.
</p><p>
Skelly has written and lectured about comics for The Comics Journal, the Center for Cartoon Studies, Fordham University, and The New School, among others. In 2017 she told NPR: "When I started drawing comics, it was to make my own reality. But now as an adult, I draw them to better understand why everyday life is extraordinary."
