The Originals is a graphic novel by Dave Gibbons, published in 2004 by American publisher Vertigo Comics.
</p><p>
The story deals with members of youth subcultures resembling the Mods and Rockers of 1960s England. However, although the setting is mostly identical to post-World War II England, it is an unspecificed alternate history where the characters ride on hovering scooters and motorcycles.
</p><p>
Much of the story focuses on violent conflicts between the Originals and their enemies, a gang of bikers which they call "the Dirt." In particular, the Originals and the Dirt battle one another in circumstances very similar to the Second Battle of Hastings.
