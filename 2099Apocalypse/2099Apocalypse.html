The world of 2099 is a cyberpunk dystopia, similar to the world of Blade Runner. North America is a corporate police state ruled by a few huge megacorporations, most notably Alchemax, which owns the private police force the Public Eye. Doom 2099, revealed to be, in fact, Victor Von Doom, would take over the United States.
</p><p>
This is the follow-up to Doom's overthrow, and covers what happens to some of the other heroes during the fall of Doom. His rule ends when the Corporate Forces bomb the White House, with Doom believed inside at the time.
</p><p>
Shortly afterward, SHIELD forces finally corner Jake Gallows, Doomâ€™s Minister of Punishment and former vigilante Punisher 2099. He takes down several agents in a hail of gunfire until a Wave Spider airship finally sent him on to his final reward. A similar fate befell Hulk 2099, the last Wild Man and a danger to the authoritarian forces.
