#1 A new evil haunts the sun-scorched back roads and ghost towns of the American South—murderous twins who command a legion of ghouls. Once again, Dancy Flammarion must face down demons: both those who walk the world unchallenged and those in her own shattered mind.
</p><p>
#2 Our deadly, psychotic, bloodthirsty hero is dead. Who will save us now?
Maisie makes a meager living conning the bereaved, even as she still mourns the loss of her friend and lover Dancy. But a pair of twisted bounty-hunting twins are planning to enact a mysterious occult ritual, and Maisie may soon find herself confronting a ghost from her own past.
</p><p>
#3 Dancy Flammarion was content to spend eternity in the nothingness of hell, but when a twisted pair of incestuous bounty hunters initiates a dark ritual, she finds herself unceremoniously cast from the afterlife into the deadly waters of the bayou! Now, new dangers are stalking Dancy, some of whom wear familiar faces.
</p><p>
#4 No sooner has Dancy been reunited with Maisie than she finds her lover violently wrested from her embrace! Now, as Maisie is held captive by a psychotic pair of gun-toting sisters, Dancy risks everything to save the woman she loves—even if it means dying... again.
</p><p>
#5 Trapped in the twisted grip of the Asquith sisters, Dancy and Maisie have resigned themselves to certain fate—but even as the end approaches, Dancy uncovers a horrifying secret that could shake her entire world to its core!
