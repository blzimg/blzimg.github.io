Created and self published in 1997 by Steve Fastner and Rich Larsen. Steve Fastner and Rich Larson have been working in concert since 1976, and together they create one entity of staggering abilities. Rich will lay down the structure of an illustration in pencil form, and then Steve will attack it with army of airbrushes - and when the dust clears - a magnificent painting stands proudly. For over a quarter of a century, they've been able to do this, working for comics, book publishers, advertising agencies, movies and television, and the web.

When Gregor Maelech was murdered, his daughter inherited a dark arsenal of arcane tools, a crumbling inner city sanctum, and a book of pacts with 17 greater and lesser demons of the infernal hierarchy. Now hell-bent for revenge on her father's killers, Talian Maelech must try to harness the sulphurous evil that would rather shred her in Hell than serve her on Earth.
