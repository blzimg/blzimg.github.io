The Squadron Supreme is a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
</p><p>
The core members of the Squadron Supreme are Hyperion, Nighthawk, Doctor Spectrum, Power Princess, and the Whizzer. The team also has several minor members. As with the Squadron Sinister supervillain team, members of the team were initially based on characters published by rival DC Comics, and the team itself was a stand-in for the Justice League. Characters not based on DC heroes were added later.
</p><p>
he Squadron Supreme are first encountered by four members of the Avengers, the Vision, Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch and Goliath, who have arrived in the Earth-712 universe by mistake. The Avengers are initially confused, since several members of the Squadron Supreme have identical names and powers to the Squadron Sinister, a group of previously encountered villains.
