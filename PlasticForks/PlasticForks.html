What happens when a scientist discovers a way to make cloning easy? Nothing good as the inventor discovers when his invention is used on him. His quest to stop the conspiracy-minded thieves and retrieve his invention makes this one of the wildest suspense tales yet. 
</p><p>
Scientist Henry Apt is freed by a bizarre fellow in a World War II bomber. First Henry has to figure out this guy's motives, then he has to decide his next move against the people who want to turn everyone into disposable human beings. Just when he thought his life couldn't get worse, Henry's house explodes! 
</p><p>
The only answer is for him to find his wife and get the asexual reproduction device removed from his groin before things deteriorate, and he falls victim to his own invention. The institute has Henry Apt's wife, Ellen. They're trying to force her to have Henry's baby, and will succeed unless Angel rescues her.
