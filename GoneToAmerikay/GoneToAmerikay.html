Series: 2012 Graphic Novel<br>
Publisher: Vertigo (DC) <br>
<p>
This sweeping, century-spanning graphic novel explores the vivid history of Irish emigres to New York City via three intertwined tales, from a penniless woman raising a daughter alone in the Five Points slum of 1870, to a struggling young artist drawn to the nascent counterculture of 1960, the year America elected its first Irish-Catholic president.
</p><p>
Written by Eisner Award-nominated writer Derek McCulloch (Stagger Lee, Pug), and beautifully illustrated with period detail by Colleen Doran (THE SANDMAN, ORBITER) and color by Jose Villarrubia.
