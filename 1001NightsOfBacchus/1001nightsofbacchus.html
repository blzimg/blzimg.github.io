Story:<br>
When Bacchus turns up at the Travellerâ€™s Joy free house, the owner treats him as an honored guest, and the patrons were happy to tip a few back with the man who invented the sport. In fact, they were so reluctant to leave after last call that the owner had to make them a deal: they could stay in the pub as long as old Bacchus stayed awake.
</p><p>
To keep him from nodding off, the patrons took turns telling their best bar stories, just as Scheherazade would tell stories in The Arabian Nights. Ultimately, their efforts were futile, but in the meanwhile they spun some great yarns of love, drunkenness, obsession, and the psychology of the dead
</p><p>
Forty-eight pages of bedtime stories for Bacchus in which we meet The Man Who Couldn't Say Boo, The Angel Seamus, Gilgamesh the Scottish Soccer Hooligan, and a bunch of dead people chewing the fat under the ground.
