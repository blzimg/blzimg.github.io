Story: Eleven-year-old Harry Potter has been living an ordinary life, constantly abused by his surly and cold uncle and aunt, Vernon and Petunia Dursley and bullied by their spoiled son Dudley. His life changes on the day of his eleventh birthday when he receives a letter of acceptance into a Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, delivered by a half-giant named Rubeus Hagrid after previous letters had been destroyed by Vernon and Petunia. 
</p><p>
Hagrid explains Harry's hidden past as the wizard son of James and Lily Potter, who are a wizard and witch respectively, and how they were murdered by the most evil and powerful dark wizard in history, Lord Voldemort, which resulted in the one-year-old Harry being sent to live with his aunt and uncle. The strangest bit of the murder was how Voldemort was unable to kill him, but instead had his powers removed and blasted away, sparking Harry's immense fame among the magical community.
