The 2004-2005 Official Handbooks of the Marvel Universe made money so they did it again in 2006. While the Handbooks of the past two years focused on specific themes, this twelve-issue monthly series will extend the coverage to all Marvel's characters, teams, objects, events, and places-plus past, future and alternate Earths. 
<p></p>
The spotlight will fall on more than 600 profiles-including new characters, characters who never received a profile and those needing major updates. As an added bonus, there will be special themed Handbooks covering more than 250 characters throughout the year.
