Deadman (Boston Brand) is a fictional character, a comic book superhero in the DC Comics universe. He first appeared in <a href="../StrangeAdventures/StrangeAdventures.html">Strange Adventures</a> #205 (October 1967), was created by Arnold Drake and Carmine Infantino, and included the first known depiction of narcotics in a story approved by the Comics Code Authority.
</p><p>
Deadman is a ghost, formerly a circus trapeze artist named Boston Brand who performed under the name Deadman, a stage persona including a red costume and white corpse makeup. When Brand is murdered during a trapeze performance by a mysterious assailant known only as the Hook, his spirit is given the power to possess any living being by a Hindu god named "Rama Kushna," in order to search for his murderer and obtain justice. It is established in Green Arrow Vol. 4, #4, that Deadman believes Rama is the supreme being of the universe.
</p><p>
At the end of the Neal Adams story line, Deadman seems to discover the truth behind his murder and the ultimate fate of Hook, who killed Deadman as part of an initiation into a society of contract killers who then kill him to silence him. However, the real Hook is one among many one-handed men who work for an organization known as "The Scavengers." This group steals advanced technology for a profit. Fighting the Scavengers also led to Deadman gaining an artificial body for some time, thanks to the influence of the Forever People. This group had rented rooms from Trixie Magruder, an old circus companion of Deadman.
