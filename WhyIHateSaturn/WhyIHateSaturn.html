Cranky Columnist Anne Merkel is only happy when she's complaining...about her editors, about being single in New York City, about running out of Scotch. But when her long-lost sister shows up claiming to be Queen of the Leather Astro-Girls of Saturn, and is being pursued by a former boyfriend mad to kill her, Anne's going to wish she'd never complained about anything.
