It's the penultimate chapter in the EARTH X saga! The Celestials return to Earth and face one of Marvel's classic heroes in a battle to the death! Meanwhile, in Asgard, Loki begs Thor, Clea and Odin, to kill him! And just who won the fight between Captain America and the Skull?! Just because this is the last issue of the limited series, don't think the action stops here... the double-sized EARTH X: X is coming your way in March! Painted cover by Alex Ross.
