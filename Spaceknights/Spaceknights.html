Spaceknights is a name used by at least three distinct groups of fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The better-known group is a core concept of the 1980s comic book Rom Spaceknight, while the other two are far more recent creations and not much is yet known about them.
</p><p>
The idea of the Spaceknights was invented by the Parker Brothers toy company as part of the background for their toy character of Rom the Spaceknight, but it was developed in the Marvel Rom comic in December 1979 (Rom #1) by writer Bill Mantlo and artist Sal Buscema. Marvel still retains ownership of the Spaceknight characters.

The original Spaceknights are an organization appearing in the Marvel Comics universe. It is an elite group of cyborg humanoids from the planet Galador, created to battle the Dire Wraiths. Rom the Spaceknight is the most well-known member.

Galador was located in a galaxy known only as "The Golden Galaxy." Galador was a paradisaical planet, with very advanced technology. Galadorians seem to be identical to normal humans, though why this is so was never explained. Also, it would seem Galadorians have a longer lifespan than Earth humans. Two hundred years ago, the planet was ruled by a man known as "The Prime Director" and its scientists had already developed a class of angel-like warriors using genetic engineering.
