<p>
Comic based on characters in the "Bob" (Bob Newhart) television sitcom. Comic is a Flip Book with one side being Marvel-style adventures and the other being animated-style adventures as done by the fictional Bob McKay.
</p><p>
Newhart portrayed Bob McKay, the creator of the 1950s comic book superhero "Mad-Dog". Mad-Dog was a casualty of the Comics Code Authority, a real-life self-regulation authority formed to assuage concerns over violence and gore in comics in the 1950s. In the wake of the CCA, Bob became a greeting card artist, and years later Mad-Dog is revived when the American-Canadian Trans-Continental Communications Company buys the rights to the series.
