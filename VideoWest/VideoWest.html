Videowest is best known for creating a new genre of video journalism, widely acclaimed as a "worldview from the rock generation" in the early eighties.
</p><p>
An independent TV studio based in San Francisco, California, Videowest produced hundreds of TV magazine shows and music videos from 1978 to 1984. Its award-winning weekly series (Backstage Pass, Best of Videowest, Rock On, Take Off) were released on a variety of broadcast and cable outlets including ABC, BBC, Disney, MTV, Showtime, USA and public TV.

Videowest's creative trademark was a fast-paced montage of interviews, comedy, music and news around weekly themes like "Beauty" or "TV" (see sample videos in the sidebar). Over the years, Videowest featured hundreds of popular artists like Laurie Anderson, Ray Bradburry, the Clash, Francis Coppola, Elvis Costello, Devo, the Ramones, REM, U2 and many more.
