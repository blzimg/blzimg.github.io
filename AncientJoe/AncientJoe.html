He never should've taken the Devil's silver. Now his wife's passed away and though Joe fears the worst, that she's trapped in Hell, a captive of El Diablo. He's determined to find her and deliver her from the Devil's clutches, whatever the cost. Aided by a down-and-out repairman and a little girl with a tragic secret, Joe follows a path that leads him through the afterlife and beyond. A god? Myth? Man? Well, who can know? Not a soul, but Ancient Joe. . .
