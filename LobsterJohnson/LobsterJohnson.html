Lobster Johnson (also known as the Lobster) is a fictional character featured in the Hellboy and Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense comic books published by Dark Horse Comics. He was created by <a href="../MikeMignola/MikeMignola.html">Mike Mignola</a>.
</p><p>
Within the Hellboy universe, the Lobster was a vigilante who worked in secret in New York City during the 1930s. Although the public believes that the Lobster was only the hero of pulp serials and comics, he was a real man who faced gangsters as well as paranormal threats. The Lobster had a reputation for violence, such as killing mobsters and burning his trademark lobster claw symbol into their foreheads with the palm of his gloved hand.

The Iron Prometheus: As America hovers on the brink of World War II, the Lobster and his allies must race against the clock as they fight their way through cannibals, yetis, and the machinations of a mysterious villain bent on fulfilling a deadly prophecy. After years of captivating fans from the pages of Hellboy and B.P.R.D., the pulp-style adventures of Lobster Johnson take the limelight in the Lobster's first solo series. Written and with covers by Hellboy creator Mike Mignola, and drawn by Jason Armstrong (Ferro City, The Sensational Spider-Man), Lobster Johnson: The Iron Prometheus is a wild ride full of fearsome monsters, mad scientists, and threats from the world beyond.
