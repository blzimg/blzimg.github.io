The film was the sixth animated feature film to be presented in Dolby surround sound.  Its production was expedited by having several animation houses working simultaneously on different segments, including Cin√©Groupe and Atkinson Film-Arts. Its an anthology of various science fiction and fantasy stories adapted from Heavy Metal magazine and original stories in the same spirit. Like the magazine, the film features a great deal of graphic violence, sexuality, and nudity. Its production was expedited by having several animation houses working simultaneously on different segments.

It opens with a green orb called the Locnar floating in space, gets picked up by a shuttle. The shuttle releases a corvette with the driver in a space suit. The driver lands and brings a case with the Locnar home to show his daughter. The Locnar disintegrates Dad and begins telling the girl examples from it's past... Excavators dig it up from a wasteland, it disintegrates the first to approach it, fade to the Harry Canyon cab driver story.
</p><p>
After preventing being robbed, Harry picks up a girl from the Locnar exposition who tells him her father has been murdered and passes out. He takes her to the police station, but doesn't have the money to get the incident investigated so he takes her home. The killer, Rudnik, makes a deal to buy the Locnar. He delivers the cash but gets disintegrated inspecting the orb. This first example ends after Harry disintegrates the girl when she attempts to take the cash.
</p><p>
The Locnar continues to tell the girl that she has powers and begins telling her the Richard Corben 'Den' story narrated by John Candy, where the Locnar falls in near Den's house as a meteor. Den hooks it up to some electricity and gets transformed as he enters a portal to a strange land. He rescues a lady being sacrificed and gets arrested by the queen's rebellion leader Arn. The leader has Wolverine level healing powers preventing Den from killing him. The queen has the Locnar and the leader wants Den to get it for him. In exchange the girl lives. Both the queen and the rebel leader are killed by the Locnar.
</p><p>
The Locnar continues it's tale, this time with the Berni Wrightson 'Captain Stern' story. But in this version Hanover Fist's hulk abilities come from the Locnar. Stern ejects him into space. The Locnar then drifts into a WWII air fight causing those that died in the fight to return from the dead. Next we roll into the Angus McKee 'So Beautiful And So Dangerous' story at a meeting at the Pentagon. The staff gets reassured that aliens do not exist by a robot that and alien ship as arrived to retrieve. The ship accidentally sucks up a secritary who is wearing the Locnar as neckless. It ends randomly and returns to Locnar who begins telling the girl the story of Taarna, with Moebius inspired art.
</p><p>
Taarna is the longest story segment, and ends after she sacrifces herself by calling up lightning and plunging into the Locnar, which explodes in that story and at the little girl's house. The girl is knocked down from the blast but awakens unharmed to Taarna's bird which flys to her side. They fly away as the narrator informs us a new Tarrakion is born to contain the evil. The little girl's hair turns white and Taarna's red sword tattoo appears on her neck.
