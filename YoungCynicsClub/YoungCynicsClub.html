It's always a pleasure to introduce a bright new talent into the comics field, a creator whose powerful visual skills are matched by an assured command of narrative: in short, a true storyteller. Such a talent is Glenn Wong, and Dark Horse is proud to present his first major work, The Young Cynics Club. You'll find no superheroes, monsters, or pin-up girls here; this is a tale of ordinary people, of longtime friends growing up and growing apart.

The wry authenticity of Wong's characterizations is underscored by the mature strength of his illustration, reminiscent of the spare elegance of Steve Rude and Jaime Hernandez. Insightful and sentimental, funny and sad, The Young Cynics Club is the first act of a career you won't want to miss.
