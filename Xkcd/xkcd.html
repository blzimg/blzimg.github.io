A webcomic of romance, sarcasm, math, and language. Munroe states on the comic's website that the name of the comic is not an initialism but "just a word with no phonetic pronunciation". The subject matter of the comic varies from statements on life and love to mathematical, programming, and scientific in-jokes. Some strips feature simple humor or pop-culture references. Although it has a cast of stick figures, the comic occasionally features landscapes, graphs and charts, and intricate mathematical patterns such as fractals.

Munroe has released three spinoff books from the comic. The first book, chronologically, published in 2010 and entitled xkcd: volume 0 was a series of select comics from his website. His 2014 book What If? is based on his blog of the same name that answers unusual science questions from readers in a light-hearted but scientifically grounded way.
