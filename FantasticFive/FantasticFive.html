Fantastic Five is a fictional superhero team appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The team exists in the MC2 Universe, an alternate future to the Marvel Universe. A continuation of the Fantastic Four, the team was originally composed of the Human Torch, his wife Ms. Fantastic/Lyja (a Skrull), the Thing, Big Brain (Reed Richards' remote-controlled robotic body), and Psi-Lord (Franklin Richards, Reed's son).

The Fantastic Five's series lasted only five issues, but they remained recurring characters in the Spider-Girl title, which lasted for 100 issues in its first volume. A new Fantastic Five mini-series was published in 2007, after the success of two mini-series events set in MC2 line.

In the first series, it was revealed that "Big Brain" is a drone controlled from the Negative Zone, where Sue Storm is held in a kind of stasis. Her powers are holding back a breach in reality, and Reed is at her side. When this problem is corrected, Reed and Sue return to Earth.
