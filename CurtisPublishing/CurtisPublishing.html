The Curtis Publishing Company, founded in 1891 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, became one of the largest and most influential publishers in the United States during the early 20th century. The company's publications included the Ladies' Home Journal and The Saturday Evening Post, The American Home, Holiday, Jack &amp; Jill, and Country Gentleman. In the 1940s, Curtis also had a comic book imprint, Novelty Press.

Curtis made these publications part of his new company. Curtis bought the Saturday Evening Post for $1000 in 1897 and developed it as one of the nation's most popular periodicals. The magazine had its roots in Ben Franklin's Pennsylvania Gazette and went as far back as 1728. When Curtis took over the Post it had a subscription base of 2,000. The base was over 1 million by 1906 and by 1960 was over six million. Editor George Lorimer brought in top writers and illustrators and helped usher in "American's Golden Age of Illustration." Artists such as Norman Rockwell were featured as well as J. C. Leyendecker, John Clymer, Stevan Dohanos, Sarah Stilwell-Weber, and John La Gatta.

Curtis Publishing still exists in the 21st century as a licensing firm that licenses their magazine covers and artwork including 4,000 images from over 500 artists. As Curtis Licensing, they license advertisement images as well as to companies creating and selling memorabilia. The Norman Rockwell and other images have been used on products such as fine art and prints, greeting cards, figurines, and other collectibles.
