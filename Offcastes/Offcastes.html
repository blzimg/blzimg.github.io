Commemorated with a cover embossed with metallic ink, Epic's new Heavy Hitter is out of this world. In the future, a privileged race inhabits the Earth, while residents of satellite planets are relegated to second class status. How does a young man cope when he's a half breed? 
</p><p>
In Vosburg's Offcastes, the Earth is home to an elite class who rule fourteen satellite worlds, while enjoying privileges lowly satellite inhabitants are denied. Zak, the half breed son of an Earthling and an otherworlder, travels with his guardian and uncle, Grant, to the colonized planets and sees first hand the injustices imposed by the government. 
</p><p>
The pace accelerates to break neck speed when Zak and Grant witness an assassination, and one of them is named a suspect. Things also heat up considerably when an exotic dancer, with designs on rugged Grant, befriends them. Charming and beautiful, the woman is also mysterious...and highly suspicious.
