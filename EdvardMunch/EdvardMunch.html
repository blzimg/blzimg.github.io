Edvard Munch (December 1863 – January 1944) was a Norwegian painter, whose best known work, The Scream, has become one of the most iconic images of world art.
</p><p>
His childhood was overshadowed by illness, bereavement and the dread of inheriting a mental condition that ran in the family. Studying at the Royal School of Art and Design in Kristiania (today’s Oslo), Munch began to live a bohemian life under the influence of nihilist Hans Jaeger, who urged him to paint his own emotional and psychological state ('soul painting'). From this would presently emerge his distinctive style.
