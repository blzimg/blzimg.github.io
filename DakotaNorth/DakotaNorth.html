Dakota North is hired to protect a fashion designer from someone who is trying to sabotage his new clothing line. To protect an experimental nerve gas sample hidden in a pen, a retired spy pursued by foreign agents lets Dakota's brother Ricky win the pen from him in a poker game. Dakota and Amos finally catch up with Ricky in Switzerland, but they are all captured by Sheik Ibn Bheik, who's after the nerve gas sample in Ricky's pen. As Dakota battles Sheik Ibn Bheik and his killer falcon, S.J. realizes that Cleo is behind the plan to capture the nerve gas Ricky is carrying. Final issue, the showdown between S.J. and Cleo is left unresolved.
