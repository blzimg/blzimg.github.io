Death Wreck premieres with a metallic ink cover. Before there was Death's Head II, there was Death Wreck, the half-cyborg, quarter man with a drinking problem, and quarter car Dr. Evelyn Necker used for a Death's Head II prototype. When the villainous Burgen attempts to kidnap Death's Head II, he accidentally ends up with Death Wreck.
