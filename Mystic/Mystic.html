Series: 10 issues 1940, 4 issues 1944, 61 issues 1951-1957<br>
Publisher: Timely, Marvel<br>
<p>
Mystic Comics is the name of three comic book series published by the company that would eventually become Marvel Comics. The first two series were superhero anthologies published by Marvel's 1930-1940s predecessor, Timely Comics, during what fans and historians call the Golden Age of comic books. The third, simply titled Mystic, was a horror fiction-suspense anthology from Marvel's 1950s forerunner, Atlas Comics.
</p><p>
A superhero anthology with no regular starring feature, Mystic Comics introduced at least three notable characters: the Blazing Skull (issue #5, March 1941), who made appearances both in the Golden Age and in the 2000s, and the Destroyer (issue #6, Oct. 1941), noted by comics historian and former Marvel editor-in-chief Roy Thomas as "Stan's most popular superhero creation before the Fantastic Four". 
</p><p>
The Destroyer was cover-featured for the last half of the run. The Black Widow is comic books' first super-powered, costumed female character; She appeared in Mystic Comics #4 (Aug. 1940) and #5 (Mar. 1941), as well as #7 (Dec. 1941). An antihero who killed evildoers to deliver their souls to Satan, her master, she is unrelated to Marvel Comics' later superspy character, Black Widow.
</p><p>
Additional superheroes introduced in this initial series include the Thin Man, by artist Klaus Nordling and an unknown writer (issue #4, Aug. 1940); the Blue Blaze, by Harry Douglas who signed his name "Harry / Douglas" leading to much confusion and many theories over the possibility of two creators. (#1-4); the robot hero Flexo the Rubber Man (#1-4); the Black Marvel (# 5-9), by artist Al Gabriele and an unknown writer (not Stan Lee as often mis-attributed); and the Terror (# 5-10) by writer Phil Sturm and penciler Syd Shores. The non-superhero trio of detectives the 3Xs (issue # 1) comprised Timely's first team feature.
</p><p>
1944 Series by Timely<br>
Timely's second series titled Mystic Comics was a shorter-lived superhero anthology that ran four issues (Oct. 1944 - March 1945). This later revival was edited by Vincent Fago as Lee had left for military duty in early 1942. Paul Gustavson's costumed detective the Angel was cover-featured for the first three, with one or two stories in each, and the Young Allies on issue #4. Timely star the Human Torch appeared in the first two issues, and time traveler Tommy Tyme in the first three. The Destroyer was the only character with a story every issue.
</p><p>
1951 Series by Atlas<br>
A science fiction horror anthology. It was launched along with Strange Tales (Marvel, 1951 series), increasing Atlas's SF line from four to six books. This book ran until the collapse of Atlas's distributor and the subsequent restructuring known as the "Atlas Implosion".
