12 issues, 2 collection TPB started in 2008 by Dark Horse. 3 season TV series started in 2019 by Netflix.<br>
Written by Gerard Way, Illustrated by Gabriel BÃ¡.   
</p><p>
The first six-issue limited series, The Umbrella Academy: Apocalypse Suite, was released by Dark Horse Comics, the first issue was released on September 19, 2007.  It won the 2008 Eisner Award for Best Finite Series/Limited Series. A second series, The Umbrella Academy: Dallas, followed in 2008. 
</p><p>
The Umbrella Academy: Hotel Oblivion, and a proposed fourth series, are in development. A television adaptation was announced to be in development in July 2015.
</p><p>
The Umbrella Academy initially takes place in an alternate history where John F. Kennedy was never assassinated, and is primarily set in 1971 (the year of writer Way's birth), which is treated as the present. The titular team is described as a "dysfunctional family of superheroes" (akin to Marvel Comics Fantastic Four). 
</p><p>
In the mid-20th century, at the instant of the finishing blow in a cosmic boxing match, 43 superpowered infants are inexplicably born to random, unconnected women who showed no signs of pregnancy (it is hinted by a character implied to be God that they are collectively a modern-day incarnation of the Messiah). 
</p><p>
Sir Reginald Hargreeves a.k.a. The Monocle, an extraterrestrial disguised as a famous entrepreneur, adopts the surviving seven children, and prepares them to save the world from an unspecified threat as the Umbrella Academy. In Apocalypse Suite, the team disbanded and failed to stay in contact with each other until they were reunited upon the news of Hargreeves' death, and subsequently reformed the team after one of their own number became a supervillain.
