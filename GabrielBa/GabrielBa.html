Gabriel Bá (1976) is a Brazilian comic book artist best known for his work on The Umbrella Academy, Casanova, and Daytripper. He is the twin brother of fellow comic book artist Fábio Moon. Gabriel Bá has been writing comics for almost 15 years, and has been published in France, Italy, Spain, the US, and Brazil. He began self-publishing comics with his brother in 1993; their first mini-series, "Sunflower and the Moon", from 1997 was released by a Brazilian publisher as a graphic novel in 2000.

They published in the United States for the first time in 1999, with the mini-series ROLAND - days of wrath, written and self-published by Shane Amaya. In the US, they have contributed on the Dark Horse anthology Autobiographix, published in 2003, alongside such comic book greats as Frank Miller and Will Eisner. Their independent comic book ROCK'n'ROLL was picked up by Image Comics and published in November 2005.

In 2006, they released De:TALES with Dark Horse, elected by Booklist as one of the 10 best Graphic Novels of that year and nominated for an Eisner Award for Best U.S. Publication of international material. Bá was the artist for Matt Fraction's Casanova, published by Image Comics. In 2007, Bá worked on The Umbrella Academy with writer Gerard Way, which is being published by Dark Horse, and his brother Fábio Moon took over the art on Casanova. In 2008, Bá self-published PIXU, a horror comics anthology, with Fabio Moon, Becky Cloonan and Vasilis Lolos.
