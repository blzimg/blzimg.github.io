Richard Sala (1955 â€“ May 2020) was an American cartoonist, illustrator, and comic book creator with a unique expressionistic style whose books often combined elements of mystery, horror and whimsy. 
</p><p>
Richard Sala was born in Oakland, California in 1955. He spent his childhood in West Chicago, Illinois, and his teenage years in Scottsdale, Arizona. In interviews, Sala has mentioned the influence of his childhood years on his work, particularly his visits to museums and antique shops. He has stated that his love of reading and his interest in comic books and horror films helped him deal with real-life fears. He attended college as an art major, finally earning a Master of Fine Arts degree in painting from Mills College. He then worked as a freelance illustrator, something he had begun doing while in college, and a cartoonist, publishing his first comic book, Night Drive, in 1984.

This was eventually expanded by Sala and director Denis Morella into a 12-minute story about a psychic detective, a hooded criminal, taxidermy, a costume party, and a secret society of one-handed killers, all done in Sala's usual tongue-in-cheek style. Divided into two-minute chapters so it could be shown as a serial, Invisible Hands debuted on the first season of MTV's Liquid Television show, which also featured the television debuts of Beavis and Butthead and Aeon Flux.

Sala has also worked on projects with Lemony Snicket, Steve Niles, and The Residents, and illustrated Doctor Sax and The Great World Snake, a script written in the 1960s by Jack Kerouac, which, like Sala's own work, makes use of pulp genre conventions such as vampires and shadowy avengers. In 2014, Sala began writing and drawing a webcomic entitled Super-Enigmatix, which follows the investigation into a sinister super-criminal. In 2016, Sala began a second webcomic, The Bloody Cardinal, also about a mystery-shrouded super-criminal. The Bloody Cardinal was published in print form by Fantagraphics in 2017.
