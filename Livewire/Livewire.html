Livewire is a fictional superhero that appears in comic books published by Valiant Comics. Created by Bob Layton and Joe St. Pierre. Livewire first appeared in Harbinger #15 (March 1993).[1] She later played a major role in the Secret Weapons (1993) series.
</p><p>
In the relaunched Valiant Universe, Livewire first appears in Harbinger's first arc. Livewire has been featured in Unity as a founding member since 2013. 
</p><p>
A psionic teletechnopath, able to control machines with force of will alone, Amanda McKee was orphaned at a young age, and sent to live in a group home. It was there that billionaire visionary and founder of the Harbinger Foundation, Toyo Harada, discovered her and took her into his care, rescuing her from the abusive environments of her early life. For this Amanda became unfailingly devoted to Harada and his mission. Assuming the name Livewire, Amanda became a star pupil of the Harbinger Foundation, eventually becoming one of Harada's most trusted aides.
</p><p>
All that changed, however, when Peter Stanchek joined the Harbinger Foundation. Faced with a power that nearly equaled his own, Harada's facade of control began to fray and his domineering tendencies became clearer and clearer to Livewire. Still faithful to Harada's vision, but believing that Peter could help balance his immense power, Livewire aided Harada's wayward student in his escape from the Harbinger Foundation and sent herself into exile following her betrayal.
