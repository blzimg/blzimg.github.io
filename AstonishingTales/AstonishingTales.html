About: Astonishing Tales began as a split title with solo features starring the jungle lord Ka-Zar and the supervillain and monarch Doctor Doom in 10–page stories each. The latter feature was dropped after issue #8 (Oct. 1971).
</p><p>
The creative team of "Doctor Doom" was initially composed of writer Roy Thomas and penciler-inker Wally Wood, a veteran of 1950s EC Comics stories and one of the early, signature artists of Daredevil. Wood remained as artist through issue #4 (Feb. 1971), succeeded by penciler George Tuska for two issues and Gene Colan for the final two. Larry Lieber was writer for #3–6, succeeded by Gerry Conway.

Story: Kraven the Hunter sets his sights on capturing Zabu, knocking out Ka-Zar in the process and then returning to New York with Zabu as his captive. Continued from X-MEN #63.
