The plot focuses on six intergalactic agents working for a governmental organization. It's one tough caper, but these guys can pull it off. They're mercenaries from all over the galaxy, and they band together for "Phase One: Phadra" the cosmic challenge of the eon.
</p><p>
Five beings with crucial information have to be found quickly, or the galaxies will be plunged into total, final war. Only one problem, though, the five are dead. Looks like the Six from Sirius have their work cut out for them. A traitor to the mission is found as Phaedra discovers the true extent of her telepathic abilities. The telepathic talents of the beautiful Ambassador are all that stand between her companions. If the Six From Sirius fall, then three planets fall with them. Meanwhile, deadly, indestructible Fax-Men close in upon the unsuspecting agents.
