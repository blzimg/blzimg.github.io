<h1>Aardvark-Vanaheim</h1>
Aardvark-Vanaheim is a Canadian independent comic book publisher founded in 1977 by Dave Sim and Deni Loubert and is best known for publishing Sim's Cerebus.
<p>
In July 1984, Aardvark-Vanaheim was threatened with possible legal action by Marvel Comics over a parody of Marvel's Wolverine character in Cerebus.
</p><p>
For a brief time, the company also published other titles, sometimes under the name Aardvark One International. This was mainly in the early 1980s, and most of these titles moved to Renegade Press. Since the 1980s the majority of titles published by the company were related to Cerebus, although since the final issue of Cerebus was published, A-V has gone on to publish other works by Sim, including glamourpuss.
</p><p>
A-V's offices are located in Kitchener, Ontario.
