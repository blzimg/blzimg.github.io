The Suicide Squad is a fictional supervillain team appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The first version of the Suicide Squad debuted in The Brave and the Bold #25 (September 1959) and the second and modern version, created by John Ostrander, debuted in Legends #3 (January 1987). One of the two teams saves the world from a threatening race of savages.

The modern incarnation of the Suicide Squad is Task Force Xâ€”a team of incarcerated supervillains who undertake high-risk black ops secret missions in exchange for either parole, work release, and/or reduced prison sentences. Regardless of abilities and talent, every member of the squad is expendable and it is expected that not many will return. As expendable assets, all members are fitted with an explosive device in their neck to assure obedience. The Suicide Squad's name alludes to the dangerous nature of their missions. The team is based out of Belle Reve Penitentiary under the directorship of Amanda Waller.
</p><p>
Various incarnations of the Suicide Squad have existed throughout the years as depicted in several self-titled comic book series, from its origins in the Silver Age, to its modern-day Post-Crisis reimagining, to the current version that was introduced in the 2016 DC Rebirth continuity reboot. The current incarnation of the team appears in the fifth volume of the Suicide Squad comic series, and the recurring members include Captain Boomerang, Deadshot, Enchantress, Harley Quinn, Katana and Killer Croc.

The group has appeared in various adaptations, including television series and an eponymous 2016 feature film and its 2021 standalone sequel.
