Lunella LaFayette is a preteen super genius who wants to change the world-but learned the hard way that it takes more than just big brains. Fearful of the monstrous inhuman genes inside her, life is turned upside down when a savage, red-scaled tyrant is teleported from prehistoric past to a far-flung future we call today. The pair are many things, and together the most amazing Marvel Team-Up.
