The Golden Age's Young Allies were a gang of kids who fought the Axis. Their line-up included the two key sidekicks of then-prominent Timely Comics heroes.
</p><p>
Created by Jack Kirby and Joe Simon as the Sentinels of Liberty, "a multiracial group of patriotic kids," the group was led by Bucky Barnes (Captain America's teenage sidekick), and initially made up of his four friends: Knuckles (Percival Aloysius O'Toole), Jeff (Jefferson Worthing Sandervilt), Tubby (Henry Tinkle), and Whitewash Jones.The group appeared in a text feature in Captain America #4 (June 1941), but were swiftly moved into the comic-proper to help Cap in his battles, and became popular enough to be spun into its own title.
</p><p>
Launched in Summer 1941 after only a couple of appearances in the pages of Captain America, the "Sentinels of Liberty" were revised, renamed "The Young Allies" and joined by the original Human Torch's sidekick Toro. By this time, Simon and Kirby were in the process of leaving Timely for DC Comics, and relationships were strained, so while the first issue of the Young Allies series was pencilled by Kirby (under the shared "Charles Nicholas" pseudonym), it was written by a young Stan Lee. By issue #2, Kirby had left, and the art duties were taken over by Al Gabriele and former Captain America inker (and then penciler, in the wake of Simon and Kirby's departure) Syd Shores. (Art duties would change considerably over the course of the title's run.)
</p><p>
The first issue saw the (mostly non-superhero) team fight Captain America's nemesis the Red Skull, and is often labelled as "the first ongoing comic to team up characters from two or more other Marvel series." The team frequently traveled the world to participate in World War II skirmishes and, in keeping with the somewhat exaggerated scope of the series, eventually literally beat up all three major Axis leaders: Adolf Hitler, Benito Mussolini, and Hideki Tojo, something that none of their elders accomplished.
</p><p>
Young Allies Comics lasted until issue #20 (October 1946), and also appeared in a handful of other titles in some form. Toro and Bucky would continue to team-up briefly, "as members of the All-Winners Squad... but Knuckles, Jeff, Tubby and Whitewash weren't seen again."
</p><p>
In the Young Allies Comics 70th Anniversary Special (2009), their comic book adventures are revealed to be fictional retellings of their real exploits. Their real names are Pat O'Toole, Washington Carver Jones, Geoffrey Worthington Vandergill, and Henry Yosef Tinklebaum. The first two are still alive in the modern day.
