1000 Jokes was a humor magazine launched by Dell Publishing in 1937. With a later title change to 1000 Jokes Magazine, it was published quarterly over three decades. During the 1950s, it was edited by Bill Yates with associate editor John Norment. The format featured brief humorous essays, short satires, cartoons and light verse. Pantomime cartoons were grouped into a section titled "Too Funny for Words". "Louder and Funnier" featured one-liners, such as, "Then there is the rich Texan who has a different dentist for every tooth."

A sister Dell publication was For Laughing Out Loud, and Dell revived the Ballyhoo title in the early 1950s. Both employed the 1000 Jokes format of mixing cartoons with short humorous essays. Today, Margate Entertainment which previously licensed Colliers Media Company has been dissolved and the assets are now owned by Tom Ficara and TVS Magazines.Com, its former owner, which publishes 1000 Jokes and other magazines.
