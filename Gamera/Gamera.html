Gamera is a kaiju originating from a series of Japanese tokusatsu films of the same name. Gamera first appeared in Daiei Film's 1965 film Gamera, the Giant Monster, which was initially produced to rival the success of Toho's Godzilla; however, Gamera has gained fame and notoriety as a Japanese icon in his own right. The character has appeared in other media such as comic books and video games.
