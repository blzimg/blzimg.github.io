After encapsulating the nostalgia of Midwestern ‘80s youth in its first year, Brian K. Vaughan and Cliff Chiang’s sci-fi bildungsroman has only gotten weirder and better as its mysteries unfurl. Image’s latest blockbuster takes four girls on a Cleveland paper route and thrusts them into a time-space conflict between the aging establishment and youthful disruptors.

Though golden-era Spielberg may have served as a starting point, Vaughan’s excellent characterization and rising stakes ratchet the tension past escapism: what does a kid do when she learns that she won’t survive into adulthood? And worse: how does a kid respond when she learns she’ll age into a mediocre, uninspired adult? These existential buzzkills loom over a candy-colored topiary of giant, warring water bears, dinosaur-mounted authoritarians and analogue robots. Artist Cliff Chiang and colorist Matt Wilson immerse the fantastic around adolescent girls who look and react like adolescent girls, a seriously impressive feat in comics.
