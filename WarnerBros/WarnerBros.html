Warner Bros. Entertainment Inc. (simply known as Warner Bros. and abbreviated as WB), also commonly known as Warner Bros. Pictures, Inc., is an American entertainment company headquartered in Burbank, California, and a division of AT&amp;T's WarnerMedia. Founded in 1923, it has operations in areas such as film, television, and video games and is one of the "Big Five" major American film studios, as well as a member of the Motion Picture Association (MPA).
</p><p>
The company's portfolio encompasses the film studios Warner Bros. Pictures, New Line Cinema, Castle Rock Entertainment and DC Films; the television production and syndication company Warner Bros. Television; the animation studios Warner Bros. Animation and Warner Animation Group; the publisher DC Comics; the video game development and publishing arm Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment; the pay television channels Cartoon Network, Boomerang and Turner Classic Movies; and a 50% interest in The CW television network, which is co-owned with ViacomCBS. Aside from content operations, Warner Bros. also has several theme parks that managed and operated by third party companies.

Warner Bros. was a pioneer of films with synchronized sound (then known as "talking pictures" or "talkies"). In 1925, at Sam's urging, Warner's agreed to add this feature to their productions. By February 1926, the studio reported a net loss of $333,413.
</p><p>
The Warners signed a contract with the sound engineer company Western Electric and established Vitaphone. In 1926, Vitaphone began making films with music and effects tracks, most notably, in the feature Don Juan starring John Barrymore. The film was silent, but it featured a large number of Vitaphone shorts at the beginning.
</p><p>
As a result of their financial problems, Warner Bros. took the next step and released The Jazz Singer starring Al Jolson. This movie, which includes little sound dialogue, but did feature sound segments of Jolson singing, was a sensation. It signaled the beginning of the era of "talking pictures" and the twilight of the silent era. Thanks to the success of The Jazz Singer, the studio was cash-rich. Jolson's next film for the company, The Singing Fool was also a success. 
</p><p>
With the success of these first talkies (The Jazz Singer, Lights of New York, The Singing Fool and The Terror), Warner Bros. became a top studio and the brothers were now able to move out from the Poverty Row section of Hollywood, and acquire a much larger studio lot in Burbank.
