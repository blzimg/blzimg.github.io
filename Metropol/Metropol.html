Series: 12 issues 1991<br>
Publisher: Epic<br>
<p>
Chronicles the beginning of the apocalypse in Ted McKeever's unique, edgy style.
</p><p>
Creepy, mesmerising, disorienting, slathered in messy detail and kinetic: METROPOL is a disturbing but strangely enjoyable read. It combines the guilty pleasure of the American obsession with Judaeo-Christian apocalysis with Buffy-generation moral heroism and the blood and guts and chaos of the scariest modern horror. 
</p><p>
McKeever's story of the collapse of the City under the weight of demonic invasion is heightened by the psychotic narrative and illustrative styles in its portrayal of modern fears in monstrous guise.
