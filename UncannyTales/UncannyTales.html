Uncanny Tales is the name of two American science-fiction / horror comic-book series, published in the 1950s and the 1970s. The first volume was by Atlas Comics, the 1950s precursor of Marvel Comics, and the second volume by Marvel. It is also the title of a British comics digest.

The first 28 issues predated the Comics Code Authority, the comics industry's self-censorship bureau. The series came under the Code's aegis with #29 (Feb. 1955). Published by Atlas Comics, the 1950s precursor of Marvel Comics, it was edited by the company's chief writer, Stan Lee, and included such art contributors as Bill Everett, Russ Heath, Fred Kida, Bernard Krigstein, Joe Maneely, Jerry Robinson, Syd Shores, Angelo Torres, and Doug Wildey.

Uncanny Tales vol. 2, cover-titled Uncanny Tales from the Grave beginning with issue #3, was a 12-issue science-fiction / horror title published by Marvel Comics (cover-dated Dec. 1973 - Oct. 1975). It consisted entirely of reprints from both the 1950s Uncanny Tales and several other Atlas and Marvel titles. The majority of issues had newly drawn covers by artists including Gil Kane (#1), Larry Lieber (#5-7) and Arvell Jones (#8).
