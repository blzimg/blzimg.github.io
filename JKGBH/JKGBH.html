An All-New series featuring characters and concepts created by Jack 'King' Kirby! In this double-sized first issue, meet the Berkleys, your typical suburban California family. But when young Garrett Berkley discovers his parents' secret-that the science fiction stories his father writes aren't fiction at all, but autobiography-he's blasted into a whole new universe of adventure, mystery and danger. Now, Jack Berkley must put down his pen, reassemble his old team, and take up the mantle of being a Galactic Bounty Hunter for one final mission!
