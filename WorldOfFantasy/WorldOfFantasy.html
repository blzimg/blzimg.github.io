SF/Horror anthology. This series was one of eight SF anthologies launched or revived in an eight-month period (cover dates October 1955â€“June 1956), increasing Atlas's SF line from eight to sixteen books. This book, along with Strange Tales (Marvel, 1951 series), was one of only two SF anthologies to resume publication immediately following the publication hiatus caused by the collapse of Atlas's distributor and the subsequent restructuring known as the "Atlas Implosion".

Bill Everett, creator of the Sub-Mariner during the period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books, was the title's most frequent cover artist, producing seven. The covers of #15 and #17-19 (Dec. 1958 and April-Aug. 1959) and a story each in #16 and #18 (Feb. and June 1959) marked some of the earliest work of Jack Kirby upon his return to Marvel Comics, after having co-created Captain America in 1940 and leaving the company a year later.
