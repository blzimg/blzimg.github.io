Nightcrawler and Wolverine must team-up with members of Alpha Flight if they hope to survive an encounter with the deadly Wendigo. Then, in a post-apocalyptic future the mutant-hunting killing machines known as the Sentinels rule America with an iron fist. Almost all mutants, super-heroes, and villains have been exterminated. Only a handful remain to fight agianst their oppressive robotic overseers. Now, Kate Pryde must travel back in time and warn the X-Men of the coming danger and maybe prevent this horrible future from ever taking place.
