The series centers around Dora, a seven-year-old American girl of Indigenous Mexican heritage, with a love of embarking on quests related to an activity that she wants to partake of or a place that she wants to go to, accompanied by her talking purple backpack and anthropomorphic monkey companion named Boots (named for his beloved pair of red boots).

Dora toys (Mattel), books (Nickelodeon), and video games (2K Games) have sold well. A live-action film adaptation is underway at Paramount Pictures (Viacom) and is scheduled for a 2019 release.
