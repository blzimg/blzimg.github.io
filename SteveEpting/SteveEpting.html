Stephen "Steve" Epting is an American comics artist. He is best known for his work on The Avengers and Captain America for Marvel Comics. In 1989, Epting read of a contest being conducted by independent comic book publisher First Comics, with the winner's story to be published by the company. Although the contest did not actually exist, First declared Epting one of the "winners" and he began drawing for the company. His assignments for First included backup stories for Nexus, guest-artist duties on Dreadstar and Whisper, and two miniseries starring Nexus supporting character Judah Maccabee: Hammer of God and Hammer of God: Sword of Justice.

By early 1991, First Comics had gone out of business, and Epting was sending submissions to other comics publishers. He found work at Marvel Comics. Originally assigned to draw half the issues in a six–part biweekly The Avengers story arc, Epting drew five of the six issues (#335–339). Shortly thereafter, he became the full-time penciler on the series with issue #341 (Nov. 1991). Working closely with writer Bob Harras and inker/colorist Tom Palmer, Epting crafted several Avengers adventures. The creative team introduced a new version of the Swordsman character in issue #343 and worked on the "Operation: Galactic Storm" crossover storyline. His stint on The Avengers ended with issue #375 (June 1994).

After leaving The Avengers in 1994, Epting spent the next few years working on Marvel's franchise of X-Men titles including the "Age of Apocalypse" crossover and Factor-X, the alternate timeline counterparts of X-Factor. He had a run on the X-Factor ongoing series, but mostly concentrated on annuals, specials, and mini-series. These included X-Men '97, Bishop: X.S.E., and the Marvel Comics/Image Comics cross-over Team X/Team 7. In 1998, Epting collaborated with writer Roger Stern on a story starring Marvel's World War II heroes, The Invaders. It was serialized in the first three issues of the Marvel Universe anthology title and was inked by Al Williamson.
