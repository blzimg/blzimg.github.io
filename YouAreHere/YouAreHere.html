Noel Coleman's got it made. He has a successful career, a house in the country, and a wonderful girlfriend. He's also been lying like crazy about his secret past. Until now. Within a day of returning to New York City to sell his apartment, Noel's being chased by the cops and stalked by a serial Killer. To top it off, his unsupecting fiancee's followed him to the city with a big suprise. Will he finally tell her the truth? And will either of them survive the experience? This critically-praised, visually dazzling graphic novel earned Writer/Artist Kyle Baker a Eisner Award for Best Writer/Artist - Humor.
