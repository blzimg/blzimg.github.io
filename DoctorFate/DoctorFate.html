Doctor Fate (also known as Fate) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character has appeared in various incarnations, with Doctor Fate being the name of several different individuals in the DC Universe who are a succession of sorcerers. The original version of the character was created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Howard Sherman, and first appeared in More Fun Comics #55 (May 1940).
</p><p>
Doctor Fate made his first live performance as Kent Nelson in the television series Smallville and was portrayed by Brent Stait. More Fun Comics #55 (May 1940) introduced the first Doctor Fate in his own self-titled six page strip. After a year with no background, his alter ego and origins were shown in More Fun Comics #67 (May 1941).
</p><p>
Doctor Fate's love interest Inza was known variably throughout the Golden Age as Inza Cramer, Inza Sanders, and Inza Carmer, which was amended to Inza Cramer in the Silver Age.
</p><p>
When the Justice Society of America was created for All Star Comics #3 (Winter 1940), Doctor Fate was one of the characters National Comics used for the joint venture with All-American Publications. He made his last appearance in the book in issue #21 (Summer 1944), virtually simultaneously with the end of his own strip in More Fun Comics #98 (July – August 1944).
</p><p>
Aside from the annual JSA/JLA team-ups in Justice League of America, DC featured the original Doctor Fate in other stories through the 1960s and 1970s, including a two-issue run with Hourman in Showcase #55–56, two appearances with Superman in World's Finest Comics (#201, Mar. 1971 and #208, Dec. 1971) and DC Comics Presents (#23, July 1980); an appearance with Batman in The Brave and the Bold (#156, Nov. 1979); and a solo story in 1st Issue Special #9 (Dec. 1975), written by Martin Pasko and drawn by Walt Simonson.

In 1920, archaeologist Sven Nelson and his son Kent go on an expedition to the Valley of Ur. While exploring a temple discovered by his father, Kent opens the tomb of Nabu the Wise and revives him from suspended animation, accidentally releasing a poisonous gas which kills Sven. Nabu takes pity on Kent and teaches him the skills of a sorcerer over the next twenty years before giving him a mystical helmet, amulet, and cloak. In 1940, Kent meets Inza Cramer and Wotan in Alexandria, Egypt on his way back to America. After arriving back in the United States, Kent begins a career fighting crime and supernatural evil as the sorcerer and superhero Doctor Fate and sets up a base in a tower in Salem, Massachusetts.
</p><p>
Kent helps co-found the Justice Society of America in 1940. Kent switches to a half helmet in 1941 due to Nabu occasionally possessing him through the helmet. Kent becomes a physician in 1942. Kent later enlists in the U.S. Army and serves as a Paratrooper during World War II. He resigns from the JSA in 1944 and becomes an archaeologist.
</p><p>
Kent returns to crimefighting when the Justice Society reforms, again using the original helmet. Sometime later, Kent co-founds a new Justice League. Soon after, Kent and Inza pass away from old age when the magic they use to stay young fails. During the Blackest Night event, Kent is briefly resurrected as a member of the Black Lantern Corps.
</p><p>
Kent becomes Dr. Fate again when he meets his grandnephew, Khalid Nassour, the current Dr. Fate. With two Helmets of Nabu, they both become Dr. Fate and fight Egyptian monsters and deities for a short period of time. Nabu later appears to Ted Kord, warning him that the Blue Beetle's scarab is magical and not science. He uses Kent's body to appear as Dr. Fate while Kent is trapped in the Tower of Fate. Kent later takes control and helps fight the enemy with Jaime Reyes and Ted Kord.
</p><p>
In the Doomsday Clock limited series, Lois Lane is mailed a flash drive which contains newsreel footage of the Justice Society, including Doctor Fate. 
Sometime prior to the start of Justice League Dark, Nabu has taken control of the Helmet of Fate and assumes Kent Nelson's appearance as Doctor Fate.
