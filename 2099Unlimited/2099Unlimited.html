About: Fans of Marvel’s dark world of 2099 get perhaps their best chance to experience it in this title. 2099 Unlimited features a variety of 2099 stories with an emphasis on strong storytelling and high production values. This title is also notable for its introduction of John Eisenhart a.k.a. Hulk 2099. 
</p><p>
Story: Eisenhart was a Hollywood dealmaker who set out to exploit a men's movement called the "Knights of Banner" for a movie premise. To his chagrin, the group refused to sell out, favoring their principles over cash. Eisenhart later learned that the group was conducting gamma experiments in the hope of recreating an Incredible Hulk for the modern age. Eisenhart used this as an excuse to call in a bloody police strike, but was exposed to radiation when the Knights’ reactor exploded. The radiation transformed Eisenhart into Hulk 2099, an angry enemy of the very "civilization" he used to represent.
