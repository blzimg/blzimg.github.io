Monsters, murder, the undead and aliens from the above creators plus Tony Tallarico, Tony Mortellero, DC war comics regular Jack Abel, Moe Marcus, Martin Rose, the very weird Paul Gattuso, and Don Perlin, all under the tutelage of the notorious Stanley Morse. We have Kurtzman-esque horror in the EC tradition, a bondage cover, and an anti-Wertham editorial. Andru and Esposito team up for the covers of #1-4 plus a story in each issue. Mortellero delivers a classic good-girl cover for #5.

And Overstreet notes "some issues have graphic dismemberment scenes." Nothing was too far out for Stanley Morse, who ran Key Publications under a variety of imprint names from 1951-56. Mister Mystery was his first title and ran an impressive 19 issues. Today it ranks in the upper tier of offbeat pre-code titles, very collectible, in part because Andru and Esposito, who would become so important at DC Comics, were getting their start here. Their work dominated each issue.

Historian Lawrence Watt-Evans wrote, "[Stanley Morse's] titles often changed publishers from one issue to the next as he dodged creditors or changed partners, and would sometimes have cover art taken from a story from a different issue as deadlines were missed. If he came up a story short, he would simply reprint something. If he couldn't get an artist for a particular slot, he'd have his editor cut up and rearrange the art from an old story to make a new one."

During the 1950s boom in horror comics, Morse "produced several acutely vile horror comics", wrote one historian, and "some of the grossest and most vile" of the time, concurred another. Interviewed for a 2008 book on 1950s horror comics, Morse said, "You did what you had to do â€” what moved 'em off the racks. ... I don't know what the hell I published.
