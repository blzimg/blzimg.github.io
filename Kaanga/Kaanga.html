One of the more successful of all the early comic book heroes was Kaanga, Lord of the Jungle (sometimes spelled "Käanga", "Kaänga" or "Ka'a'nga").
</p><p>
Like Tarzan, Kaanga was a young Caucasian boy whose parents died in the jungle, leaving him to be raised by apes. Unlike Tarzan, his name and exact ancestry were never given. Like Tarzan, he grew up perfectly at home with the wild beasts and other perils of his surroundings, but never felt quite right with civilization. Unlike Tarzan, he had blond hair. Like Tarzan, he nonetheless fell in love with a civilized woman (Ann Mason, whom he met while rescuing her from a slave trader), who became his lifelong mate.
</p><p>
Kaanga first appeared in Jungle Comics #1 (January, 1940), one of the early comic books published by Fiction House, which was long established in the pulp magazine market. It was part of an effort to duplicate the publisher's pulp line in the new medium; and that line had included Jungle Stories, which starred a Tarzan clone named Ki-Gor, since 1937. Kaanga was the cover feature of the new title, and remained so as long as it lasted. The writer who created him (at least, to the extent the word "created" applies in this case) is unknown. The artist was Alex Blum, who also worked for Fox Feature Syndicate, where he co-created their Samson, and who drew quite a few issues of Classics Illustrated.
