Al Bizarro tries to end his miserable, misbegotten life by jumping in front of a truck...and gets rescued by the Man of Steel himself! Seems poor Al can't do anything wrong...er, right! Plus, Lex Luthor tries to reclaim his suicidal property and the Guardian tries to keep Al from embarking on a life of crime in Suicide Slum.

Al Bizarro's become a millionaire pop star, but now that he's worth a fortune, in comes Luthor who claims that, as patent-holder, he owns everything Al's earned. So Al does what any self- respecting pop prince would do in these circumstances and flees the country in the shocking "Â¡Viva Bizarro!"
