Grey Eagle, chief of the Comanches is informed that his wife has given birth to a son. Grey Eagle then calls for a celebration and then goes into the mountains near their tribe and asks for the blessing of their god Manitou. Seeing lightning strike off in the distance as a sign of Manitou's blessing, Grey Eagle names his son Red Warrior and sees that he is trained to be his people's greatest warrior.
</p><p>
As he is growing up, Red Warrior learns the ways of the Comanche people, tasks both done by men and women to make him the most self-sufficient member of their tribe. Learning medicine and how to make clothing from the women, and learning hunting from the men. As he grew older, Red Warrior succeeded in slaying a bear, now cowering when the massive creature charged at him and killing it with a knife through the heart.
</p><p>
When Red Warrior reached adulthood he and his father were alerted of an attack by white outlaws that slew some of their people. After relocating their camp, the attacks still continued. While Grey Eagle believed the attackers were from the trading post, Red Warrior had heard stories that the instigators were men who were drunk off liquor that were responsible. Their investigation is cut short when they spot smoke coming from their village and rush back home. 
</p><p>
There they find their people had been attacked while most of the warriors were away on a hunting party. Among the slaughter is Red Warrior's mother who tells her son who attacked them before dying. Red Warrior then tells Grey Eagle to move his people while he tracked down and got revenge for his tribe.
</p><p>
Following the killers back trail, the Red Warrior traces them back to their camp and finds that the killers are a bunch of drunk outlaws taking pleasuring in having attacked the defenceless Natives. Furious, the Red Warrior attacks with his bow and arrow then charges into the group of men slaying the survivors with is knife. With all the outlaws dead, Red Warrior cries in triumph and then returns to his tribe.
</p><p>
As Red Warrior and some of his fellow Comanche braves head to the trading post at Tumbleweed City to trade their first. They are observed by Hanna and his gang who plot to murder the men at the trading post and rob it, as well as steal the pelts from the Comanches. The outlaws slay the men at the trading post. Red Warrior and his men arrive soon after and are fooled into thinking that they are legitimate traders. However, the outlaws soon show their true colors, murdering Red Warrior's braves and knocking the hero out and robbing them of their pelts and gold and make a clean getaway.
</p><p>
When Red Warrior awakens to find his warriors dead, he prays to Manitou to avenge the death of his people. Manitou hears Red Warrior's prayers and creates a raging storm to slow up Hanna and his men. As Hanna and his men ride through the storm, some of them drown in a flash blood. Soon, Hanna's greed gets the better of him and soon he guns down all of his minions until he is the only one death. Only when he is alone does Red Warrior catch up to Hanna and kills him with a bow and arrow, avenging his slain warriors.
