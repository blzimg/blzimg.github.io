<p>
Kitten, Maribel, and Gaby are three very different girls with one single purpose, break their pal Una out of her Tijuana prison cell! With the super-powered guards pulling overtime, that's no easy feat. But if the job can be pulled off, this is the trio that'll do it. Kitten can crush the most fearsome robots with her atomic eyebeams; Maribel is the queen of the savage Hollywood jungles; and Gaby . . . well, not even a 1950 Caddy can bowl over Gaby. So it's off to Tijuana in Gilbert Hernandez's Girl Crazy.
