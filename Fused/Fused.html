Mark Haggerty, a young robotics engineer becomes the unwilling pawn of two colliding egos bent on each other's destruction. During a routine test, Mark is permanently fused with a experimental robot suit. Trapped, he finds himself accused of murder and the target of a worldwide manhunt. On the run and rapidly becoming amalgamated with a complex exo- skeleton, Mark must fight through misguided military forces and units of government-sanctioned superheroes, and somehow get his life back.

"Canned Heat" Ex-Air Force pilot Mark Haggerty works as a robotics engineer. He works hard. He has a wife who loves him. They have a nice home in the 'burbs. It's a good life...until Mark stumbles into the crosshairs of two destructive men. The resulting catastrophe fuses Mark inside an indestructible robot suit called CY-BOT. In the blink of an eye Mark's life is turned upside down and the world is given a new hero!

For Mark Haggerty life has become more than a little complicated. He's been fused inside of a robotic Cy-Bot exo-suit, forced to live on a military base, and become the subject of endless tests, all the while trying to figure out how to relate to his wife from inside a hulking metal body. If that weren't enough now he has to defend himself against the unwanted advances of group of superheroes who want to recruit Mark into their ranks... It's enough to give even a robot an ulcer. Judging from the mysterious ache in Mark's metal "stomach" it may just have done that!
