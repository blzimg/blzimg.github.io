In the tradition of Little Nemo and Where the Wild Things Are comes an all-new limited series of wonder and fantasy, danger and adventure, mutants and ducks?! In recent months, readers have seen an eclectic collection of visitors gathering at the Massachusetts Academy.

When we last saw them in Generation X (1994) #25, this motley crew escaped certain doom by getting absorbed into the body of Man-Thing, the empathetic swamp creature who also happens to be the guardian of the Nexus of All Realities! Now, along with their mossy chaperone, these extraordinary adventurers find themselves on a wondrous journey through dimensions, finding excitement and mysteries galore while learning about themselves and each other. Featuring Franklin Richards, surviving son of Reed and Sue Richards (and potentially the world's most powerful mutant), the thought-projecting mutant child named Artie, the young Morlock power-dampener called Leech, the Rigellian alien child known as Tana Nile and the cynical waterfowl trapped in a world he never made, Howard the Duck!
