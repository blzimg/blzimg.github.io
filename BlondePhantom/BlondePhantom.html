Series: on-going<br>
Publisher: 1946 Marvel<br>
<p>
The Blonde Phantom (Louise Grant Mason) first appeared in All Select Comics #11 (1946), which was popular enough for them to change the title to Blonde Phantom #12.
</p><p>
The creator of the Blonde Phantom is disputed. Don Markstein's Toonopedia says the character was created by Stan Lee and Syd Shores, but Al Sulman claimed to have created the character during his time at Timely Comics. Comics.org shows Bill Woolfolk as the writer adding "credit confirmed from Woolfolk's records." 
</p><p>
The Blonde Phantom debuted in <a href="../AllSelect/AllSelect.html">All Select Comics</a> #11 (in 1946), which became Blonde Phantom Comics #12 the following issue.
</p><p>
The series lasted a little over two years (from #12–22, Winter 1946 to March 1949), during which time the crime fighter also appeared as a backup feature in:
<ul>
<li><a href="../MarvelComics/marvelcomics.html">Marvel Mystery Comics</a> #84–91 (1947-1949)</li>
<li><a href="../AllWinners/AllWinners.html">All Winners Comics</a> #1 (1948)</li>
<li>Sub-Mariner Comics #25–28, 30 (1948-1949)</li>
<li><a href="../BlackstoneMagician/BlackstoneMagician.html">Blackstone the Magician</a> (#2–4, May–Sept. 1948)</li>
<li>Namora #2 (Oct. 1948)</li>
<li>Sun Girl #2–3 (Oct.-Dec. 1948)</li>
</ul>
Blonde Phantom Comics changed titles and formats completely to become the anthological romance comic Lovers with issue #23 (May 1949).
</p><p>
The character's civilian identity, Louise Mason, was reintroduced in The Sensational She-Hulk #2 (June 1989). Two issues later, she was revealed to be the retired former superhero. Mason remained a series cast-member through the final issue, #60 (Feb. 1994). She was featured in flashback adventures in All-Select Comics 70th Anniversary Special (Feb. 2009) and the five-issue miniseries <a href="../Avengers/Avengers.html">Avengers</a> 1959, beginning with issue #1 (Dec. 2011).
