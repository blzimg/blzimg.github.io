Alessandro Orlandelli, he was born in the small town of Opera in the outskirts of Milan Italy.  His love for the fantastic came early while reading his favorite Marvel comics in the seventies.  He started to try and draw them when he was in kindergarten and even taught himself the English language by reading comic books. 
</p><p>
</p><p>
Early on he made a trip to London to meet with the editors of Monster Massacre and Blackball Comics.  He was instantly commissioned for several pin-ups.  He also started working for Marvel Italy and producing character designs for The Mutant Chronicles published by Acclaim/Dark Horse.
</p><p>
It was then the editors and art directors at DC Comics discovered Alex’s work. He signed on for a Lobo mini-series, several painted covers and story layouts for both the DC and Vertigo division. He was also part of the Batman Master Series.  A group of trading cards later reprinted in a hard cover format art book.
</p><p>
Alex then entered the world of adult format comics.  He was commissioned by Glen Danzig to produce several pin-ups and story layouts for his Verotik Comics.  He also began a series of projects for Penthouse Comix and received an overwhelming response from its readers.  In addition, he began the designs and layouts for “Sharky”, a new mini-series for Image Comics.  He was also chosen to be one of the artists to be featured in the Frank Frazetta Fantasy Illustrated Magazine.
</p><p>
The owner and publisher of Heavy Metal Magazine, Kevin Eastman, then contacted Alex. After completing an eight-page short story for the publication, Kevin asked Alex to produce covers and calendar art annually along with a series of limited edition posters.
</p><p>
In addition to Heavy Metal, Alex produced cover art for countless comics and magazines including titles for Devils Due, Vampirella, and the Comic Book Buyers Guide. DC Comics then enlisted Alex to fully paint the six issue mini-series “Lobo Unbound”.  The first issue was an instant sell out and DC Direct asked Alex to design a high end limited edition statue based on the cover art from the issue.  Later they would ask Alex to produce box art for a Lobo action figure being produced by Mattel to be sold exclusively at the San Diego Comic Con.
</p><p>
During this time Alex began to work with the gaming company Wizards of the Coast on one of the most popular trading card games in the world, Magic: The Gathering and has produced more the 120 cards for the game.  He was also one of a select group of artists chosen to work on their Harry Potter Game.
</p><p>
Soon after, he was asked to start producing art for a new game to be based on one of the biggest properties in the computer gaming industry, “World of Warcraft.”  After completing a successful signing tour throughout Europe to launch the game, Alex was asked to create the art for a special stackable collector tin card box for their market.  His eye-popping illustrations became and instant favorite amongst the staff of the games creators at Blizzard Entertainment.
