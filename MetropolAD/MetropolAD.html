Ted McKeever is back with the sequel to his great tale of good vs. evil. A year has passed since the events in Metropol, and a new battle of epic proportions is about to ensue. The remaining human population's only hope for survival rests with a small band of Angels. 
</p><p>
Thousands of demons now rule the city of Metropol and give the Angels a dangerous ultimatum. Should they escape the city and risk spilling the plague of demons into the world or stay and risk being destroyed?
</p><p>
In the stunning finale, the Angels take a daring chance with a nuclear arsenal. Seven-month old Joshua isn't about to see his family destroyed, so he takes matters into his own hands. Can a few tarnished Angels save what's left of humanity?
