Vaughn Bodē (1941 – 1975) was an American underground cartoonist and illustrator known for his character Cheech Wizard and his artwork depicting voluptuous women. A contemporary of Ralph Bakshi, Bodē has been credited as an influence on Bakshi's animated films Wizards and The Lord of the Rings. Bodē has a huge following among graffiti artists, with his characters remaining a popular subject.
</p><p>
Bodē was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame for comics artists in 2006.
</p><p>
In 1963, at age 21, and while living in Utica, New York, Bodē self-published Das Kämpf, considered one of the first underground comic books. His next title would become one of his most famous, Cheech Wizard. Cheech is a wizard whose large yellow hat (decorated with black and red stars) covers his entire body except his legs and his big red feet. 
</p><p>
After an initial run in The Sword of Damocles, the strip continued for a few more years in The Daily Orange, the student-written newspaper at Syracuse University. Episodes of Cheech Wizard ran in the "Funny Pages" of National Lampoon magazine in almost every issue from 1971 to 1975.
</p><p>
Print Mint published four issues of Bodē's solo series Junkwaffel from 1971–1974. Bodē's graphic novel The Man, published by Print Mint in 1972, is about a caveman who accidentally makes important observations about life. 
</p><p>
After joining the Army at age 19, Bodē went AWOL but later received an honorable discharge due to a psychiatric diagnosis. Around 1970–1971, led Bodē to cross-dressing, transvestism, and even a short-lived experiment with female hormones.
</p><p>
Bodē described his sexuality as "auto-sexual, heterosexual, homosexual, mano-sexual, sado-sexual, trans-sexual, uni-sexual, omni-sexual."
</p><p>
Bodē's death was due to autoerotic asphyxiation. "Bode's self-inflicted death came as no surprise to his close associates," Patrick Rosendkranz, an underground historian, wronte in Counter Media. "He'd been undergoing a strange personal and career change, hanging out with the late-night S&amp;M crowd, preparting for a sex change operation, and practicing bizarre masterbation/strangulation techniques." 
</p><p>
At the time of is move to San Francisco in 1974 he was already a transvestite and a sadomasaochist with a rubber fetish. Once in San Francisco, he fell in with the glitter dolls, suicide freaks, and assorted male and female lovers.
</p><p>
He told his 12 year old son that he would be meditating in his room, not to be distrubed. His last words were to his son: "Mark, I've seen God four times, and I'm going to see him again soon. That's No. 1 to me, and you're No. 2."
</p><p>
In a doorway in his room there was a chinning bar, over which Bode looped a leather belt with the buckling pin removed. He arranged pillows on the floor underneath the belt, put on a red rubber devil's mask, and slipped his neck through the loop. With one hand he pulled the belt tight around his neck and with the other he masterbated. For some reason the belt didn't release as usual, he fell unconscious and remained hanging. Vaughn's brother came over and found him hanging there dead.
</p><p>
Thirty-three years old at the time of his death, Bodē's ashes were dropped from a Cessna airplane over the waters off the coast of Point Reyes.
</p><p>
He left behind a library of sketchbooks, journals, finished and unfinished works, paintings, and comic strips. Most of his art has since been published in a variety of collections, mostly from Fantagraphics.
