The secret is out! The new super hero people can't stop talking about is named... ARANA! That's pronounced ah-rahn-ya, for all you gringos!

Straight from AMAZING FANTASY, the continuing adventures of Anya Corazon, scrappy teen from Brooklyn by day, and by night, the butt-kicking Hunter of the ancient and mystical Spider Society.

As seen in the NY Daily News, Fox News, CNN, and Telemundo, Marvel's first Latina super hero is getting a brand-new monthly book and sporting a new dimension to her costume.
