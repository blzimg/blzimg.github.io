Albertine Randall was one of the earliest female cartoonists. She was born in San Francisco, the youngest of four children, and attended the San Francisco School of Design. She drew magazine illustrations for Harper's Bazaar, Harper's Young People, St. Nicholas and others.

The artist married San Francisco businessman and Harvard graduate, Fairfax Henry Wheelan, in San Francisco in 1887. They had two sons, Edgar Stow Wheelan and Fairfax Randall Wheelan.

Edgar Wheelan created the comic strip <a href="../FatAndSlat/FatAndSlat.html">Fat and Slat</a>, and also went on to become a nationally syndicated comic artist. When her husband died in San Francisco in 1915, the artist settled in New York City, and signed many of her later works with her married name, Albertine Randall Wheelan.
