A nigh omnipotent being from beyond has, for lack of a better word, kidnapped the greatest heroes and deadliest villains in the Marvel Universe and whisked them to the far side of the universe to battle for the ultimate prize. 
</p><p>
Heroes and villains each find themselves in space ships. They witness the creation of Battleworld. The Beyonder tells them that their goal is to defeat their enemies and their wildest dreams will come true. Galactus and Doom fly off to confront the Beyonder but are repulsed. The heroes are transported to the planet and turn on Magneto. 
</p><p>
The villains are also moved to Battleworld and Doom tries to reason with them concerning the Beyonder's wishes. When no one is willing to listen, he flies off to talk to Reed but is shot down by Kang. The heroes reach Doom but get blasted.
