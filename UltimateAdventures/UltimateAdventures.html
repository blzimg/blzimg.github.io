Ultimate Adventures was a six-issue comic book, written by Ron Zimmerman and drawn by Duncan Fegredo, and published by Marvel Comics. It starred Hawk-Owl and Woody, two characters who were purposefully designed as blatant parodies of Batman and Robin. At the time of its publication, it was the only Ultimate title to introduce characters who were not explicitly based on pre-existing Marvel characters. (Ultimate Spider-Man followed suit with Geldoff and the series Ultimate X-Men has since added the characters of Syndicate and Magician.)

At a Catholic orphanage located in Chicago, Hank Kipple is currently being disciplined for bad behavior (namely rigging the lights in the dorm rooms to not only use the Clapper, but also only to respond to his claps) and saying "God can shove it." Later on,there is a scene of Hank in his dorm room with several other children who live at the orphanage. It appears that his brash, rude manner even extends to his peers, and not just his authority figures. 
</p><p>
He also comments on the persistent danger of crime that is associated with living in an orphanage in downtown Chicago. Sure enough, as the children go to sleep, two burglars seek refuge in the dorm room of St. Frederick's. Hank starts smart-mouthing to the burglars, putting the other children of the orphanage in danger as the burglars decide to make them hostages. Just as one of the burglars begin threatening the children, a voice comes from the rafters of the old orphanage. 
</p><p>
It's Hawk-Owl, the Midnight Avenger. While the children don't recognize him (and some of the younger kids mistake him for Spider-Man), both of the thugs recognize him almost immediately. With Hank's help, the Hawk-Owl makes short work of the burglars with an assortment of crime-fighting tools.
