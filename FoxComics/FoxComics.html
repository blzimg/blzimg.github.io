Fox Feature Syndicate (also known as Fox Comics and Fox Publications) was a comic book publisher from early in the period known to fans and historians as the Golden Age of Comic Books. Founded by entrepreneur Victor S. Fox, it produced such titles as Blue Beetle, Fantastic Comics and Mystery Men Comics. It is unrelated to the company Fox Publications, a Colorado publisher of railroad photography books, or the 20th Century Fox film studio and associated companies.
