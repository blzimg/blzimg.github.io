The Women of Marvel event continues with the blockbuster of the summer, a fast-paced five-issue weekly series by Kathryn Immonen and Tonci Zonjic! 
</p><p>
Powerful forces are converging on Earth and the women of the Marvel Universe are at the center of it! Years ago, a herald of Galactus sacrificed her life for the universe. Little did anyone realize, a shred of that spirit lived on...and now she's back for vengeance on those who abandoned her. 
</p><p>
The most powerful super heroines of the Marvel Universe must put aside their differences to stop this threat before the Earth is destroyed. Emma Frost, She-Hulk, Agent Abigail Brand, Hellcat, Valkyrie, Monica Rambeau, Sue Storm...these mighty women will be put to the test as never before, as cities are destroyed, families are torn apart, and a cosmic resurrection changes the heroes' lives forever!
