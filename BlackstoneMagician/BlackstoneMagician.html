Blackstone, Master Magician was a 1946 American comic book series, created by Afro-American comics artist Elmer Cecil Stoner. This series was not nearly as successful as the 1938 magician character <a href="../MandrakeTheMagician/MandrakeTheMagician.html">Mandrake the Magician</a>. Despite a short run it did inspire a popular radio detective drama series from 1948 until 1950.
</p><p>
The first comic featuring Blackstone was issue #1 (the only issue) of "Super Magic comics". The first title issue, named "Blackstone, Master Magician" was published in March-April 1946 with art work by Elmer Cecil Stoner and text by Walter B. Gibson. It was published by Vital Publications and featured the adventures of a magician, Blackstone, who also investigates crime mysteries. His name and visual appearance were based on real-life magician Harry Blackstone, Sr., but only generated 6 issues across 4 publishers. Interest in the character faded with the end of the radio show.
