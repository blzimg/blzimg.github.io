Neat Stuff is an American alternative comic book series created by <a href="../PeterBagge/PeterBagge.html">Peter Bagge</a> and published by Fantagraphics. It ran from 1985 to 1989 for fifteen issues. Each takes the form of a series of short stories featuring different sets of characters, although some issues feature full-length stories relating to just one set of characters. The series was Bagge's first one-man comics anthology.
</p><p>
Described by Dez Skinn in Comix: The Underground Revolution as the work which "threw Peter Bagge into the limelight", Bagge soon retired the title in preference of continuing the Bradley characters' story in Hate.
</p><p>
Neat Stuff's contents were collected in four books: The Bradleys, Studs Kirby, Junior and Other Losers, and Stupid Comics. Fantagraphics reprinted all fifteen issues in 2016 in a two-volume hardcover collection.
