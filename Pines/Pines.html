Standard Comics was an American comic book company owned by publisher Ned Pines. Standard in turn was the parent company of two comic-book lines: Better and Nedor Publishing. Collectors and historians sometimes refer to them collectively as "Standard/Better/Nedor". In the late 1950s, Standard's remaining two titles were incorporated into the Pines Comics lineup.
