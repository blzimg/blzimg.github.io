John Thomas Alexis Craig (1926–2001) was an American comic book artist notable for his work with the EC Comics line of the 1950s. He sometimes used the pseudonyms Jay Taycee and F. C. Aljohn.

Returning to comics after his discharge, he began drawing for EC Comics, beginning with the penciling and inking the cover of Moon Girl and the Prince #1 (cover-dated Fall 1947). He did additional work on the following issue of that science fiction / superhero series, now titled simply Moon Girl, and went on to draw stories for the EC Western comics Saddle Justice and Gunfighter and the crime comic Crime Patrol; he later expanded into romance comics with EC's Modern Love Craig additionally did a small amount of early work for Magazine Enterprises, American Comics Group and, tentatively identified through the pen name "Jay", possibly for Eastern Color's New Heroic Comics. When he teamed with Al Feldstein, they used the pseudonym F. C. Aljohn.

Craig later brought a clean, crisp, naturalistic approach to EC's legendary horror series—The Crypt of Terror, The Vault of Horror and The Haunt of Fear — plus Crime SuspenStories and Two-Fisted Tales. Wally Wood once said Craig drew "the cleanest horror stories you ever saw". In being a writer as well as an artist, Craig differed from the majority of EC artists. He was responsible for the stories hosted by the Vault-Keeper, and he also drew that horror host in the framing sequences of stories by other EC illustrators.
