Joe Canelli is a crooked cop working in a corrupt police force. Joe is haunted by nightmares of powerlessness. When his partner is brutally murdered and he's betrayed by his colleagues, it appears that Joe's nightmares are coming true. With his back against the wall there's only one thing he can do--turn against the criminal network that he once embraced. Kickback is a fast-paced, action-filled, noir-style, crime thriller from the co-creator of V for Vendetta, David Lloyd.
