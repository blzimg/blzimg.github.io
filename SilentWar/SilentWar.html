Silent War is a six-issue Marvel Comics comic book limited series which began in January 2007. It was written by David Hine, with art by Frazer Irving. It is a sequel to the "House of M" and "Son of M" storylines, detailing the war between the Inhumans and rest of humanity after the mutant Quicksilver stole the Terrigen Mists from Attilan.
</p><p>
In the opening stages of the war, Black Bolt ordered a strike on America led by Gorgon. Although the initial mission was only to order the return of the Terrigen crystals, Jolen, a young member of the Inhumans who has plant like powers, kills innocents in a concert hall. The Inhuman task force attempts to flee the scene, but they are stopped and defeated in battle by the Fantastic Four. 
</p><p>
Gorgon surrenders and takes the blame for the unnecessary casualties and is turned over to O.N.E. While in captivity, Gorgon is exposed again to the Terrigen mists by an American scientist. The second transformation is more disastrous, turning Gorgon into a feral beast. 
</p><p>
Black Bolt then leads a contingent of Inhumans to rescue the mutated Gorgon, attacking the Pentagon and reclaiming the crystals. S.H.I.E.L.D. responds to Black Bolt's attack by sending Marines who have been exposed to the mists to assault the Inhuman capital on the moon, Attilan. These Marines possess abilities on par with the Inhumans, but are also dying due to cellular instability.
</p><p>
In the last issue of Silent War, the Marines again assail Attilan and are repulsed. In reality, this battle was a feint designed to allow one Marine to explode within the confines of the city, destroying lunar Attilan. Black Bolt's mad brother Maximus infects the Inhuman race, taking Medusa as his queen. Luna, who was responsible for freeing Maximus from his psychic prison, goes to Black Bolt asking him what she should do. Black Bolt opens his mouth to answer. The final page of the issue is completely black.
