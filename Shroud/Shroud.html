10-year old Maximilian Quincy Coleridge was orphaned when his parents were gunned down before his eyes in a hold-up. Embittered, the youth decided to dedicate his life to fighting crime. Entering college, he studied law and criminology and began a rugged regimen of exercise to build his body to its peak of physical potential. 
</p><p>
Upon graduation, he traveled to Nepal to the temple of the Cult of Kali to study their martial arts and mystical disciplines. For seven years he studied among them until his masters believed he had learned all he could. He was then prepared to receive the ceremonial "Kiss of Kali" from a branding iron whose imprint was in the shape of the goddess Kali. The man screamed when the branding iron was pressed against his eyes, cheeks, and forehead. Believing his masters to have betrayed him, he stumbled out of the temple to bury his scarred face in the snow. 
</p><p>
When he recovered from the shock and pain, he discovered that his eyesight had been replaced by a mystical extrasensory perception. Inexplicably, he was unable to perceive the temple anymore, so he made his way back to civilization and America, where he adopted the identity of the Shroud.
