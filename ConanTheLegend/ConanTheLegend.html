Conan The Legend features a 16-page prelude story introducing readers to the sprawling, lusty, battle-filled legend of Conan, establishing characters and situations important to the series, and setting the stage for the adventures to come. Plus a sketchbook gallery of artist Cary Nord's stunning work and a mini-interview with writer Kurt Busiek.
