Imagine Six Feet Under with cockroaches and you've got Vertigo's twisted new monthly series THE EXERMINATORS, written by breakout debut writer Simon Oliver with spine-tingling visuals by Eisner-nominated artist Tony Moore (The Walking Dead), a smart, scary, darkly comic tale of roaches, rats, raccoons and the men who kill them for a living. 
</p><p>
THE EXTERMINATORS centers on a dysfunctional group of bug killers prowling the barrios and bungalows of Los Angeles - the thinnest point on the shaky borderline between civilization and the violent chaos of nature. Henry James, the newest exterminator, sees the job as a means to cleanse the sins of his dark past. He has a hard time getting his view across to his careerist girlfriend, sociopathic partner, and the general bunch of freaks he calls co-workers.

What the 'bug brothers' of Bug-Bee-Gone Co. don't understand is that human beings may be the true pests - and bugs could be the real exterminators. Featuring creepy-crawly covers by Philip Bond (VIMANARAMA), THE EXTERMINATORS mixes disturbing characters, killer cockroaches and sinister secrets into a unique and unsettling series that branches out from the underbelly of L.A. into the heart of an ancient mystery, a sacred scarab beetle and a weirdly ominous locked box. It's a bug's world. We just live in it.
