The numbering continues with The Badger (First, 1985 series) #5.
</p><p>
The Badger is a fictional character, a superhero in American comic books publisher by the short-lived Capital Comics company (1983) and then First Comics (1985). He was created by writer Mike Baron in 1983 and published through the early 1990s in a titular series that ended when First Comics also ceased all publications. 
</p><p>
Since the ongoing series ended in 1991, new Badger titles have been released through Dark Horse Comics, Image Comics and IDW Publishing.
</p><p>
Badger was mostly set in Madison, Wisconsin, where Capital Comics was situated. The lead character was Norbert Sykes, a Vietnam war veteran suffering from multiple personality disorder. "The Badger", an urban vigilante who could talk to animals, was just one of his personalities. 
</p><p>
Bizarrely, he would often call people "Larry", and it was later revealed that "Larry" was the name of his father who left his mother when Norbert was five. His mother remarried Rollin Sykes who physically abused Norbert. 
</p><p>
After escaping from a mental institution, Norbert met a 5th-century Druid named Ham (Hammaglystwythkbrngxxaxolotl in full), who had just awakened from an 800-year coma (this was later corrected in dialogue where it was noted that Ham's coma lasted 1500 years). 
</p><p>
Ham took the Badger in as a boarder in his castle in return for the Badger's bodyguard services. Other characters included Norbert's caseworker Daisy, Vietnamese martial arts expert (and Norbert's wife) Mavis, and Lord Weterlackus, a demon who empowered Ham until they had a falling-out. 
</p><p>
Prior to his coma, Ham would sacrifice children in his castle in Wales (Ham was placed in a mystical coma for 1500 years by all the other wizards), but after his resurrection he would sacrifice animals (which enraged the Badger) or computer files. Ham would use his power over weather to influence markets and generate wealth for himself. 
</p><p>
Occasionally his supernatural dealings would bring him into conflict with demons, whom the Badger would then be called upon to fight.

Issue #1:<br>
Hamilton Thorndyke (Ham the Weather Wizard), a 5th Century Druid, meets Norbert Sykes (The Badger) and Daisy Fields (a psychotherapist) in a mental institution. They all hit it off well and join together (with Ham as employer) on the outside.
