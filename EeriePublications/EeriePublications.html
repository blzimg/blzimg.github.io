Eerie Publications was a publisher of black-and-white horror-anthology comics magazines, less well-known and not to be confused with the field's leader, Warren Publishing  who did Eerie magazine as well as Creepy and Vampirella. This publisher was run by comic-book artist and 1970s magazine entrepreneur Myron Fass.

New material was mixed with reprints from 1950s pre-Comics Code horror comics. Writer and artist credits seldom appeared, but included Marvel Comics penciler/inkers Dick Ayers and Chic Stone, as well as Fass himself, with brother Irving Fass and Ezra Jackson serving as art directors. Mel Lenny initially and then Golden Age of Comic Books producer Robert W. Farrell had the title of publisher. Carl Burgos, creator of the Golden Age original Human Torch, was editor, he created a short-lived character called Captain Marvel, no relation to either the old Fawcett Comics superhero nor Marvel's Captain Marvel, for Fass' M. F. Enterprises in 1966.
