Masters of the Universe (sometimes referred to as the He-Man or She-Ra series) is a media franchise created by Mattel. The main premise revolves around the conflict between He-Man (the most powerful man in the universe and alter ego of Prince Adam), against the sorcerer Skeletor on the planet Eternia, with a vast lineup of supporting characters in a hybrid setting of medieval sword and sorcery and sci-fi technology. 
</p><p>
A follow-up series, She-Ra: Princess of Power, features He-Man's sister She-Ra (the most powerful woman in the universe and alter ego of Princess Adora) and her struggle against the The Horde on the planet Etheria. Since its initial launch, the franchise has spawned a variety of products, including multiple lines of action figures, five animated television series, several comic series, video games, a daily newspaper comic strip, and two feature films (one animated, one live action).

He-Man and the accompanying Masters of the Universe franchise would make their debut in 1982 with Mattel's release of the original "Masters of the Universe" 5.5-inch action-figure toy line. Masters of the Universe, often abbreviated as MOTU, would begin its mythos through the minicomics that accompanied the toys throughout the 1980s. These initial mini comics were soon followed by several children's books and issues of DC Comics. However, the Masters of the Universe franchise would become best known through Filmation's groundbreaking He-Man and the Masters of the Universe animated series. Debuting in the fall of 1983, the Filmation series ran 130 episodes over two seasons until November 1985.

Masters of the Universe: The Motion Picture starring Dolph Lundgren was released theatrically in the United States on August 7, 1987. It was a critical and commercial failure, grossing $17 million worldwide against a budget of $22 million, but is now regarded as a classic cult film.

The New Adventures of He-Man is an American-Canadian animated series which ran in syndication in the fall of 1990 while Mattel released the toy line He-Man, an update of their Masters of the Universe line. The cartoon series was intended to be a continuation of Filmation's He-Man and the Masters of the Universe series. Filmation had gone defunct a year earlier and this series was meant to continue on from He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, which itself was in syndication at the time.
</p><p>
She-Ra was introduced in the movie The Secret of the Sword as Force Captain Adora of the Evil Horde ruling Etheria, but turned out to be Princess Adora, the long-lost twin sister of He-Man, Prince Adam. DreamWorks Animation and Netflix announced a new reboot series based on She-Ra, entitled, "She-Ra and the Princesses of Power". It premiered on November 13, 2018 on Netflix.

Noah Centineo in an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon, confirmed that he will be playing He-Man in the Masters of the Universe film that is due to begin production in July 2019 and is set for a 2020 release.
