<p>
Issue #1 What Price Utopia?: Golden City, a modern-day utopia, once the envy of the world. It was the place where crime rarely existed, where harmony prevailed, where everyone wanted to live.
</p><p>
But then things went sour: Titan, one of the city's protectors, went rogue. Grace, mayor and founding mother of Golden City, disappeared. People began to lose faith, to lose hope. Golden City needed a new leader, one who could help this once-great utopia rise again from its pit of uncertainty.
</p><p>
Enter the mysterious man known as Law. Law enters Golden City and seems to have all the answers to the city's woes, but demands absolute authority if he's to set things right. Is he a modern-day messiah who will restore Golden City to greatness, or is he a charismatic killer who craves despotic domination? But don't ask the members of super-team Catalyst that question: they can't seem to agree about Law.
</p><p>
Issue #2 As the utopia of Golden City reels from the deaths of two of its superpowered guardians, Grace and Madison, its citizens look to the man called Law for guidance and leadership. But is he creating a new foundation for the city to stand on or spinning a web of deception for his own benefit? The heavy-hitting armored hero Mecha wants an answer to that question, and he's willing to tear down the city to get it! Plus: the secret of Law's power is revealed, and there's a juicy cameo appearance by Barb Wire!
</p><p>
Issue #3 Law is the new leader of Golden City, but not everyone has pledged the mystery man their undying loyalty! This issue, Law reveals his twisted new toy, the Judgement Gate, and his personal agenda becomes even more evident. Meanwhile, the Rebel brothers are embroiled in a deadly conflict and Warmaker finds himself accused of a scandalous deed.
</p><p>
Issue #4 What price paradise? Law flings open the gates of Golden City for all who wish to enter, but will the city still stand when the chaos ensues? Meanwhile, in our nation's capital, the president of the U.S. discovers, in a rather brutal fashion, that even he can't escape from the long arm of Law.
</p><p>
Issue #5 Not satisfied with his already formidable power, Law orders the creation of an augmenting implant that should take him over the top! But while he tinkers with technology to increase his influence, a hooded figure lurks the shadows and alleyways claiming to be the former ruler of Golden City.
</p><p>
Issue #6 Golden City's new leader Law is considered a savior by some, and Satan by others. But there's someone new in town who has a whole different view of Law: He considers him meat. The once utopian Golden City has become hunting ground to a Predator, and he's got his lasers trained on Law!
