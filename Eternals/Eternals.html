"The Day of the Gods." Written by Jack Kirby. Pencils by Jack Kirby. Inks by John Verpoorten. 
</p><p>
What if all the stories were true? All myths...all the legends... What if all the stories about gods and monsters were true? For archeologist Doctor Damian and his daughter Margo, those legends are about to become reality. The gods are real and they've lived among us for centuries. 1st appearance of Ikaris, Makkari, Kro and the Eternals as a team. 
</p><p>
The Eternals are a fictional race of super humans appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. They are described as an offshoot of the evolutionary process that created sentient life on Earth. The original instigators of this process, the alien Celestials, intended the Eternals to be the defenders of Earth, which leads to the inevitability of war against their destructive counterparts, the Deviants. The Eternals were created by Jack Kirby and made their first appearance in The Eternals #1 (July 1976).
</p><p>
In 1970, Jack Kirby left Marvel Comics to work at DC Comics, where he began the saga of the New Gods, an epic story involving mythological and science fiction concepts, and planned to have a definite ending. However, the saga was left incomplete after the cancellation of the titles involved. Kirby began The Eternals when he returned to Marvel. The Eternals' saga was thematically similar to the New Gods', and the series was also eventually canceled without resolving many of its plots. Writers Roy Thomas and Mark Gruenwald used the Eternals in a Thor storyline that climaxed in Thor #301, resolving those lingering plot lines. 
</p><p>
Subsequent to the Thor storyline, the Eternals (and the mythology connected to them) have appeared or been mentioned in numerous Marvel comics. In particular, the Celestials' experiment on humanity has been used to explain how certain humans can develop super-powers. The Titanians (created by Jim Starlin) and Uranians (created by Stan Lee) were later retroactively connected as being Eternals as well.
