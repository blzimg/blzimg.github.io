The Airtight Garage was also the name of a bar and videogame parlor in the Metreon in San Francisco, featuring unique original games developed for the venue. The name and architectural styling was no coincidence, and Moebius souvenirs could be purchased there.

The "garage" itself is actually an asteroid in the constellation Leo which houses a pocket universe. Major Grubert orbits the asteroid in his spaceship Ciguri, from which he oversees the development of the worlds contained within. Several entities, including Jerry Cornelius, seek to invade the garage.
