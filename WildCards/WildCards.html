Based on the Wild Cards science fiction novels edited by "Game of Thrones" author George R. R. Martin.

Featuring the origins of two of the most popular Aces (Golden Boy and Croyd Crenson), the secrets of the archer known as the Yeoman, and more on the mystery of the Jokers who call themselves the Werewolves. The Great and Powerful Turtle faces a bomb threat in the Jokertown Clinic. If you've never encountered the Great and Powerful Turtle, you've never really met a great super hero. The deck seems stacked against the Aces as they must deal with protests by the Nats and the Jokers.
