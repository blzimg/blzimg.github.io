Set in Europe, where the apes have a much richer inheritance than their more familiar cousins, Ape City harkens back in some ways to Pierre Boulle's original novel. The situation in Europe was different than in North America in the aftermath of the Ape Revolution - there was food and drink aplenty, buildings stood intact and such luxuries as electricity, entertainment and charge cards were still available. 
</p><p>
In orbit, a spacecraft appeared carrying six assassins from 1990: Scab, Devon, Moriah, Jo Taylor (daughter of astronaut George Taylor), MX and Pi. These six, the Vindicators, were sent here to kill as many apes as possible. They left the ship, and a teenage chimp named Flannagan climbed aboard to explore. He stole a crystal from a control panel to show his mentor, Dr. Benday. Benday's aim was to learn how to repair the human power plants, which had begun to malfunction since Europe's humans died of the plague. 
</p><p>
Mongo, a chimp lounge-singer, traveled to this part of the country, where he met a pack of Baboonjas, a baboon cult led by the sorcerer Krak. Able to sense the crystal's powers, the Baboonjas vowed to steal it. Mongo also met Rox, who let him travel with her for protection. The Vindicators, meanwhile, killed 57 apes before returning to their ship. Without the crystal to power their systems, however, they could not go home.
