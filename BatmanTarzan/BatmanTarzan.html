Both are orphaned noblemen who have honed their minds and bodies to the peak of human performance. Both have sworn to protect their respective territories: for Tarzan, the jungle; for Batman, Gotham City. 
</p><p>
Now, a new evil has surfaced: one that will bring these two legendary heroes together for the first time; one that threatens both of their "jungles." And all clues point to a mysterious female cat burglar and an archaeologist named Dent.
</p><p>
The mysterious African Cat-woman is not about to let the ancient, priceless treasures of her lost jungle city be plundered by the archaeologist known as Dent. Who better to enlist in her cause than Batman and Tarzan? It will take all of the jungle-bred instincts of Tarzan and the detective skills of the Dark Knight to save this opulent lost civilization.
