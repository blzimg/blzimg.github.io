Blue Ribbon Comics is the name of two American comic book anthology series, the first published by the Archie Comics predecessor MLJ Magazines Inc., commonly known as MLJ Comics, during the 1930s and 1940s period known as the Golden Age of Comic Books, and the second published in the 1980s by Archie Comics under the Red Circle and Archie Adventure Series banners.
</p><p>
Blue Ribbon Comics was also the title of an unrelated six-issue comic book series published in 1948–1949 by St. John Publications. 
</p><p>
The first series of Blue Ribbon Comics #1–22 (Nov. 1939 – March 1942) was a 64-page anthology comic published by MLJ Magazines Inc., commonly known as MLJ Comics, the precursor to what would become the publisher Archie Comics. Issues #9–18 and #22 were cover-titled Blue Ribbon Mystery Comics. The series was edited by Harry Shorten.
</p><p>
The first title published by MLJ, Blue Ribbon Comics initially ran a mixture of content, in the manner of most early comic books. These included the science-fiction feature "Dan Hastings" (#1–2), crime, short humor fillers, and adventure tales such as, from issue #1, "Burk of the Briny" in #1 and Cliff Thorndyke's African adventure "Village of Missing Men". "Rang-A-Tang the Wonder Dog", the tales of an intelligent dog in the Rin Tin Tin vein, written by Joe Blair and primarily drawn by Ed Smalle, was the only feature to appear in every issue. 
</p><p>
Another, "Corporal Collins, Infantryman", a war feature drawn by Charles Biro, about a U.S. soldier stranded in France when World War II breaks out was in every issue but the first. As all comic books did through the early 1960s, to satisfy U.S. Postal Service requirements for magazine rates, Blue Ribbon Comics also contained text stories, sometimes about characters from the comics features, such as the titular cowboy Buck Stacey.
