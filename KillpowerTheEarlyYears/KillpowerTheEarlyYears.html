MyS-TECH's deadliest assassin...as you've never seen him before. Readers met Killpower in the pages of Battletide and Motormouth, and now he gets his own 4-issue limited series.This 'Pumping Iron' title guest stars Codename: Genetix. When the Time Guardian sends Killpower back in time, Codename: Genetix is hot on his heels thanks to the evil MyS-TECH Board. The Punisher guest stars. When Killpower is attacked by Branch's brutal lackeys, the Punisher gives him a hand in knocking them off. Then, Killpower is catapulted into the far future with Genetix, where they are ambushed by a raging horde of mutants. The limited series comes to a dramatic conclusion. Killpower and Genetix face certain death in a terrifying future as Branch gains both halves of the Chronifact.

I hope it is better than it looks because it looks like a good example of why people get made fun of for reading comics, the people that tease think they are all like this.
