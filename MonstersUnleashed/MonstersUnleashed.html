Monsters Unleashed is the title of an American black-and-white comics magazine published by Magazine Management and two color comic-book miniseries from Marvel Comics. The first ran from 1973 to 1975. The two miniseries ran consecutively in 2017.

A magazine rather than a comic book, it did not fall under the purview of the comics industry's self-censorship Comics Code Authority, allowing the title to feature stronger content — such as moderate profanity, partial nudity, and more graphic violence — than color comics of the time.

Issue #1 "The Man Who Cried Werewolf" originally written by Robert Bloch, cover by Gary Morrow, adaptation written by Gerry Conway, illustrated by Pablo Marcos. 1st appearance Solomon Kane.
