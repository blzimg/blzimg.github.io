<h2>House of Women</h2>
<img src="HouseOfWomen.jpg"> <br>
Creator: Sophie Goldstein<br>
Series: one-shot Graphic Novel<br>
Publisher: 2017 Fantagraphics <br>
<p>
Alternately spiky and luscious, House of Women draws you in by receding. Cartoonist Sophie Goldstein writes with economy about an interstellar commune of ladies, but the resulting story isn’t irritatingly arty or hard to follow; it’s not drawn by a comics artist only for other comics artists who speak the lingo and can read the subtext.

It’s no surprise, in fact, that Margaret Atwood (restless, relentless experimenter, unafraid to leap into any genre that grabs her interest, including comics) is an inspiration for this female, centered and complexly feminist story of colonization and controlled social dynamics. Goldstein provides no easy answers, the book is thematically driven rather than focused on plot first and foremost, but she knows how to be just difficult enough.
