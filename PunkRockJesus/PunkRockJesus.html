Punk Rock Jesus is a six-issue limited series comic book created by Sean Murphy and released on DC Comics' Vertigo Comics imprint. The series ran for six issues from September 2012 to January 2013 and was collected as a trade paperback in April 2013.
</p><p>
In 2019 an entertainment company named OPHIS (Greek for serpent) starts whats known as the "J2 Project", a plan to resurrect Jesus Christ. A clone of Jesus Christ is made with DNA from the Shroud of Turin. The young jesus is raised on an island with his entire life dictated and televised and viewed by nearly the entire world. 
</p><p>
Faced with these stresses the young Jesus ultimately becomes a rebellious punk rocker. Religious zealots either love or hate the show and politicians begin to fret over potential influences on the nation. The scientific community fears the implications of the cloning itself.
