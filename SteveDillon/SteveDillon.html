Steve Dillon (22 March 1962 – 22 October 2016) was a British comic book artist, from Luton, Bedfordshire, best known for his work with writer Garth Ennis on <a href="../Hellblazer/Hellblazer.html">Hellblazer</a>, <a href="../Preacher/Preacher.html">Preacher</a> and <a href="../Punisher/Punisher.html">The Punisher</a>. He got his first professional work at the age of 16, drawing the title story in the first issue of Hulk Weekly for Marvel UK. He then worked on Nick Fury, a strip about a World War Two army hero and present-day super-spy. Alongside Garth Ennis he went on to create the superior graphic novel series Preacher, which focuses on Texas and an examination of the myths and realities of the American Dream. This highly violent story tells the tale of a Texan priest, his assassin ex-girlfriend, and an Irish vampire called Cassidy. Dillon's artwork along with clever and addictive storylines have enabled Preacher to become one of the most renowned comic series of our generation. In July 2007 he sold it to Hollywood for a movie/TV adaptation.
