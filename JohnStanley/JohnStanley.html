John Stanley (1914â€“1993) was an American cartoonist and comic book writer, best known for writing and drawing Marge's <a href="../LittleLulu/LittleLulu.html">Little Lulu</a> comic book stories from 1945 to 1959.
</p><p>
Stanley was respected by his peers. He has been compared to Carl Barks, and cartoonist Fred Hembeck has dubbed him "the most consistently funny cartoonist to work in the comic book medium". Captain Marvel co-creator C. C. Beck remarked, "The only comic books I ever read and enjoyed were Little Lulu and Donald Duck".
</p><p>
Whereas the old Saturday Evening Post panels depicted the humorous antics of a mischievous tomboy, Stanley quickly expanded the cast of characters in Lulu's universe to an entire neighborhood of children while sketching out rich characterizations that captured as Don Phelps noted "the mannerisms and slang" of kids.
</p><p>
Little Lulu #135, in early 1959, was Stanley's last, whereupon he began writing Nancy and Sluggo (titled Nancy for issues #146-173) starting with issue #162 and through at least #185, as well as several Dell Giant's (#34 & 45, and Nancy & Sluggo Traveltime).
</p><p>
In the 1960s Stanley created a number of humorous titles for Dell Comics. These include:
<ul>
<li>Kookie #1-2 1961-1962, drawn by Bill Williams. Kookie is a 20-something single girl living in a Greenwich Village-like environment with roommate Clara and working in a hip coffee shop. Supporting characters include Momma Poppa, the brash, overweight owner of the coffee shop, and Bongo and Bop and other beatniks. The subjects of their own back-of-the-book story, Bongo and Bop never interacted directly with Kookie.

<li>Around the Block with Dunc & Loo #1-8 1961-1963, humor with urban teens drawn by Bill Williams.
<li>Thirteen (Going on Eighteen) #1-25 1961-1967, humor with suburban pre-teens drawn by Stanley starting with #3.
<li>Melvin Monster #1-9 1965-1969, humorous horror drawn by Stanley.
</ul>
