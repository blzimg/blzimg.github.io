Fish Police is a comic book and TV series, created, written and drawn by Steve Moncuse.
</p><p>
The plot centers on law and crime in a fictional underwater metropolis with the protagonist, Inspector Gill, trying to solve various, often Mafia-related, crimes while avoiding being seduced by the buxom Angel Jones. The comic featured several marine species as its characters, while the plots and dialogue were reminiscent of film noir.
</p><p>
Hanna-Barbera Productions adapted Fish Police into an animated television series that was first broadcast on CBS in 1992, lasting only six episodes over one season. The show was cancelled after only three episodes; the remaining three episodes have never been shown in the US. 
</p><p>
Fish Police had a decidedly more mature tone than most other animated Hanna-Barbera series, with episodes often filled with innuendo and cases of mild language. It also featured several stars' voices, including Ed Asner, John Ritter, Tim Curry, Hector Elizondo, Buddy Hackett, Megan Mullally, Robert Guillaume and JoBeth Williams.
</p><p>
Fish Police started in 1985 as a self-published black-and-white title by Moncuse through his own Fishwrap Productions. After 11 issues, the title was picked up by Comico in 1987, which reprinted issues 1-4 in a trade titled Hairballs, followed by color reprints of the other Fishwrap issues. Comico also printed a special prequel issue, and continued the series at number 12.
</p><p>
After issue 17, Comico went bankrupt, but Fish Police was then acquired by Apple Press, which continued the numbering begun by Comico and reverted the comic to black-and-white. Apple published the title until early 1991, stopping at number 26, in addition to printing an Issue 0 which featured an early draft of the stories seen in issues 1-5. 
</p><p>
In 1992â€“1993, After the TV deal, Marvel Comics reprinted the first six issues again, in color.
</p><p>
Apple also printed a six-issue spin-off, Fish Shticks, between 1992 and 1993. Written by Moncuse and drawn by Steve Hauk, this series was more gag-based than the original. In 2010, Moncuse began work on a new Fish Police title, set 20 years after the end of the original. IDW Publishing re-printed the first four Fishwrap issues in a trade in February 2011. 
</p><p>
A new story written and drawn by Moncuse, titled "F. P. B. C.", appeared in Dark Horse Presents issue 22, March 2013.
