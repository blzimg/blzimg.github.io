Marvel's Ghost Rider story continued in Western Gunfighters (Marvel, 1970 series) #1-7. Night Rider was originally called Ghost Rider, and was renamed Night Rider following the introduction of Marvel's motorcycle-riding character called <a href="https://blzim.github.io/kb/Creation/GhostRider/GhostRider.html">Ghost Rider</a>.
</p><p>
Marvel's first Ghost Rider look was based on the Magazine Enterprises character <a href="../GhostRider1950/GhostRider1950.html">Ghost Rider</a> (Rex Fury), created by writer Ray Krank and artist Dick Ayers for editor Vincent Sullivan in Tim Holt #11 (1949). The character appeared in horror-themed Western stories through the run of Tim Holt, Red Mask, and A-1 Comics up until the institution of the Comics Code.
</p><p>
After the trademark to the character's name and motif lapsed, Marvel Comics debuted its own near-identical, horror-free version of the character in Ghost Rider #1 (cover-dated Feb. 1967), by writers Roy Thomas and Gary Friedrich and original Ghost Rider artist Ayers. The song "(Ghost) Riders in the Sky: A Cowboy Legend", being popular at the time, inspired the comics.[citation needed] The song was also the inspiration for the Magazine Enterprises' horror-Western comic-book character the Ghost Rider.
</p><p>
With the introduction of Marvel's supernatural Ghost Rider in the 1970s, Marvel renamed its Western Ghost Rider — first, to the unfortunate Night Rider (a term previously used in the Southern United States to refer to members of the Ku Klux Klan) in a 1974–1975 reprint series, and then to Phantom Rider. At least five men have been the Phantom Rider, one of whom is active in the modern day.
</p><p>
The Magazine Enterprises library of characters, including its version of Ghost Rider, was reprinted by AC Comics in the 1980s. While the copyrights have lapsed due to non-renewal, AC renamed the Ghost Rider as the Haunted Horseman, due to Marvel having maintained the Ghost Rider trademark.
