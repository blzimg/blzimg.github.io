"THE FLAW IN ALL THINGS"<br>
My curse is that I see the flaw in all things. Systems. Philosophies. Structures. People. Everything. Never forget who I am. I am Karnak of the Inhumans.' Phil Coulson goes to Karnak to help with a SHIELD case with Inhuman implications and what he's going to find will terrify you.
</p><p>
Karnak versus a warehouse full of enemy agents! The agents don't stand a chance. But the Zen Gunner can turn the air itself into a deadly weapon? Karnak's in trouble. Just when you thought Karnak couldn't get more intense and insane, it does. The trail left by the kidnapped Inhuman gets nuclear and Karnak is caught in the mushroom cloud. 
</p><p>
A death cult has abducted an Inhuman child and installed him as their messiah. Magister Karnak of the Tower of Wisdom, hired by the family to retrieve the boy...might be finding that the death cult members are not the bad guys. Karnak has reached the heart of the IDIC death cult, and he knows what happened to the abducted boy. Now he just has to get out alive. Unless he joins the cult. And brings on the end of the world. Which is strangely possible. The end of 'The Flaw In All Things.' Karnak has it in his lethal hands to save humanity - or end it. And nobody knows what he's going to do.
