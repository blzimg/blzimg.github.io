Thanos plunges into combat with seemingly a whole world full of warrior mercenaries, destroying them all single handed with hardly even relying on his energy blast powers; Disappointed in the challenge he returns to his ship; Thanos breaks the mind of the Oracle of Ancient Knowledge, but finds his infinite well of knowledge a little lacking; He learns of Tyrant, a powerful opponent worthy of his efforts.
