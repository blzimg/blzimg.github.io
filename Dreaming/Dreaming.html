This issue: Part 1 of a 3-part story arc by writer Terry LaBan and artist Peter Snejbjerg, centering on the former House of Secrets and House of Mystery frontmen, Cain and Abel. In it, Cain murders Abel once too often, so Goldie the infant Gargoyle runs away from the House of Secrets, only to fall under the seductive influence of a limbless being calling himself Tempto. Together, the two embark on a voyage of discovery to some of the farthest reaches of the Dreaming.
