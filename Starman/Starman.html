Starman is a name used by several different DC Comics superheroes, most prominently Ted Knight and his sons David and Jack.
</p><p>
Created by writer Gardner Fox and artist Jack Burnley, the original Starman, Ted Knight, first appeared in Adventure Comics #61 (April 1941). An astronomer, Knight invented a "gravity rod", later reinvented as a "cosmic rod", allowing him to fly and manipulate energy, and donned a red and green costume with a distinctive finned helmet.
</p><p>
Like most Golden Age heroes, Starman fell into obscurity in the 1950s. In the ensuing years, several characters, with varying degrees of relation to the original, briefly took the mantle of Starman.
</p><p>
In Zero Hour: Crisis in Time #1 (September 1994), writer James Robinson and artist Tony Harris introduced Jack Knight, the son of the first Starman. A reluctant non-costumed hero, he inherited his father’s name and mission and used his technology to create a cosmic staff. He starred in a critically acclaimed series, written by Robinson, from 1994 until 2001.
</p><p>
The current successor of Starman is Stargirl, formerly the second Star-Spangled Kid.
</p><p>
Starman, announcing that he comes "from the past," appears in Justice League #7 (November 2018) and subsequent issues.
</p><p>
Theodore Henry Knight is a 1940s DC Comics superhero who wore a red costume with a finned helmet and a green cape, and wielded a "gravity rod" (later "cosmic rod") which enabled him to fly and fire energy bolts. He is a member of the Justice Society of America.
</p><p>
Mikaal Tomas (also known as Michael Thomas) is a DC Comics superhero, introduced in the 1970s. Tomas is an alien who traveled to Earth to help conquer it, but instead turned against his war-like people in defense of the human race.
