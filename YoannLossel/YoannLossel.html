Born in Strasbourg, France, in 1985, Yoann Losselâ€™s interest in art and painting began with the discovery of the Old Master paintings of the Renaissance, which he found at home and contemplated during his childhood. Fascinated by the breathtaking masterpieces depicting its mysterious themes and filled with fabulous creativity, he has been dreaming about becoming a painter ever since.
</p><p>
After a three-year degree in applied arts and narrative drawing at the Ecole Pivaut of Nantes, Yoann Lossel worked as a freelance illustrator. At the age of 25, he eventually left the publishing world to devote himself to exhibitions and collaborations with art galleries. 
</p><p>
Yoann Lossel has exhibited his work in numerous galleries around the world, mainly in the United States. Award-winning artist, he is well known for his meticulous work combining graphite and gold leaf, legacy of the iconography that he cherishes such as the Italian Renaissance, the Symbolist, Pre-Raphaelites, Art Nouveau and Arts &amp; Crafts movements.

He currently lives in the legendary Broceliande forest in Brittany.
