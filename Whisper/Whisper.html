Whisper is Diane Young, but this is a forged set of ID. She was born Alexis Devin. Alex was raised in Japan, where Hatsumi Jiro, her grandfather, trained her in aikido and infiltration. Jiro was Yakuza, and had some long-term projects for Alex.  As a gaijin with poor social skills the girl was ostracised, and tried to defend herself against hostile Japanese schoolgirls. She later was sent back to America, where she didn’t fit in much better. She managed to get a little life, but still felt hollow inside.
</p><p>
She then got dragged into her father and her grandfather’s criminal activities, and became Whisper. She thought that putting on a costume would make her a superhero, but what it really made her was a target. Her grandfather died. Her father was rendered a vegetable, and later died. Kirk, her boyfriend and the only person she ever loved, was killed by the CIA due to his anarchist activities (hacking, nuclear research and so on).
</p><p>
Alex faked her death and became Diane Young, fleeing to L.A.. The only person from her past who’s still alive is a friend from her college days, Lesa, who also got a new identity. Due to her skills, activities in the underworld, politics and proximity to Kirk, Whisper has had numerous problems with government agencies. These have attempted to use her, to assassinate her, and managed to get her to conduct a few jobs. One right-wing CIA agent, Bain, even started developing a sexual fixation on Whisper. He ran a sadistic game of death with her for a few years.
