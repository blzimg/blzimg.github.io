The sorcerors behind the serial in Diamond Preview's "The Sticky Fingered Homunculus" hatch a new plan to bring down the Hammer. Many forces converge at once, as a detective tries to sort out a bizarre series of murders, leading to a very surprising connection to the Hammer's past. Kelley Jones (Batman: Crimson Mist) begins a new novel-length tale, with an equal mix of macabre atmosphere and hardcore action.
