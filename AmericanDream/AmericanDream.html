Shannon Carter has been featured in Marvel Comics MC2 series A-Next. Her costume is very similar to that of Captain America. Her initial weapons are throwing disks like Ricochet's but later obtains the trademark shield. She appeared as a civilian in A-Next #1, and was named as "Shannon" in A-Next #3; it was not until A-Next #4 that she appeared in costume as a prospective team member.

The niece of S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Sharon Carter, Shannon Carter grew up idolizing Captain America. She was hired by Edwin Jarvis as a tour guide for the Avengers Headquarters, at that time functioning only as a museum. When the new Avengers team was formed, she was determined to join. 
</p><p>
She wears a costume based on Captain America's and carries on her arms disc weapons resembling miniature versions of his shield. Her strength and agility are honed by intensive physical training. After joining the team as the American Dream, Shannon soon proved herself to be an effective Avenger, and when the team saved the original Avengers from a dark parallel world, Captain America himself judged her worthy to wield the shield of the alternate Captain.
