In the premiere issue of this riotously funny series, detective Lance Barnes accidentally triggers a nuclear holocaust. All the world's a Salvador Dali painting when Lance suffers delusions during nicotine withdrawal. But when a one armed man is beaten to death, Lance earns cigarettes by solving the murder. When Lance and One Leg Peg arrive at the ruins of a shopping mall, one of the warring tribes who inhabit it hires Lance to gather info on a rival clan. The hilarious limited series concludes! When a team of ex-bankers tries to force unwitting individuals to pay the colossal national debt of the former United States, Lance gets cracking.
