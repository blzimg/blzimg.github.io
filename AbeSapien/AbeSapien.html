Abraham "Abe" Sapien, born Langdon Everett Caul, is a fictional character introduced in the comic book series Hellboy, created by Mike Mignola. He takes his name from "Ichthyo sapien", the fanciful species designation chosen for him by his colleagues in the 19th-century Oannes Club, and from Abraham Lincoln, on whose assassination date the Oannes Club abandoned Abe's body, leaving only a cryptic note as explanation, in a suspended animation tank beneath a Washington D.C. hospital. He is occasionally referred to as an "amphibious man."
</p><p>
As well as regular appearances in Hellboy and B.P.R.D., Sapien has also starred in his own comics, with trade paperback collections and omnibus editions including The Drowning, The Devil Does Not Jest and Other Stories, Dark and Terrible and Lost Lives and Other Stories.
</p><p> 

Issue #1 The Drowning: A century ago, paranormal investigator Edward Grey fought and destroyed a powerful warlock off the island of Saint-Sébastien. In the early 1980s, the B.P.R.D.'s newest agent was sent to retrieve the warlock's remains. But Abe Sapien is ill prepared for the supernatural forces that block his way. 
</p><p>
Issue #2 The Devil Does Not Jest: Supernatural forces converge on the island of Saint-Sebastien as Abe finds himself alone against a century-old evil.
</p><p>
Issue #3 Dark and Terrible New Race of Man: On the run from the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense, a mutated Abe Sapien faces horrifying monsters, desperate madmen, and cities in ruin, on his quest to reveal his own role in the end of the world. 
</p><p>
Issue #4 The Shape of Things to Come: A mutated Abe Sapien fights carnivorous monsters crawling out of the desert sand, a fortified militia that's walled Phoenix off from the rest of the world, and a viscous zombie swarm, while a mad necromancer rises over the monster-infested ruins of Seattle.
</p><p>
Issue #5 Sacred Places: Haunted by deaths he's seen and ones he's caused, Abe returns to the place where he was shot, where his latest transformation began. His path is blocked by strange priests, apocalyptic prophets, and one doomed soul after another, who all seem to think Abe is either the answer or the cause.
</p><p>
Issue #6 A Darkness So Great: Abe Sapien stands accused of bringing about the end of the human race. He hits the devastated Gulf Coast, where the infestation of monsters began and a volcano leveled Houston, driving out most of the population. Taking refuge with a Mexican death cult in a strangely preserved south Texas town, Abe stands to lose what little he has left, where demons dwell and the dead walk.
</p><p>
Issue #7 The Secret Fire: Having traveled across the country searching for the truth about himself, Abe Sapien uncovers the secrets he’s been looking for when he faces a giant monster that tore off part of the Florida coast, and a young girl with a psychic bond to the most ancient powers in the Hellboy mythology. 
</p><p>
Issue #8 The Desolate Shore: Abe Sapien's "Dark and Terrible" story reaches its finale, and the answers Abe uncovers about his own existence reveal some of the biggest secrets of the Hellboy saga. AWOL from the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense for more than a year, Abe travels to two lost kingdoms before returning to America. There he'll confront the most nightmarish version of the fate he's run from all along, as well as the necromancer who sees Abe as a means to control the end of mankind.
</p><p>
Issue #9 Lost Lives and Other Stories: Abe Sapien confronts South American vampires, a lake serpent, and a disembodied Lovecraftian tentacle, while uncovering the secrets of a 19th century necromancer who still walks the earth, and a frozen merman that may prove to be the missing link between himself and mankind. Looking back on his life as a man in 1850s Englan, we trace the history and pre-history of Abe Sapien's adventures, from his earliest days in the Bureau with Hellboy through the frog war, to his current evolved form.
