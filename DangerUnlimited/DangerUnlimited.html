In 1960, four heroes fought to save the world. In 2060, who will fight to reclaim it? A freak accident gave four friends strength and abilities that set them apart from normal men, and they used these abilities to fight the tide of evil as Danger Unlimited! Fast forward to the far-flung future, when the never-ending battle is actually nearing its end and the side of justice is losing. Earth has been conquered by an alien race and super-powered humans have been outlawed. The human race needs some help, some heavy-duty firepower, if it's going to turn the tide and take back earth. It needs another Danger Unlimited.

How much can the world change in 75 years? Don't ask Cal Carson. He's spent three quarters of a century in stasis, but now memories of his membership in the original Danger Unlimited team are gone. Still, he's pretty sure the alien Xlerii shouldn't be ruling the earth.

Doc Danger, Miss Mirage, Thermal and Hunk officially announce their existence to the world of 1960, and the new crew of 2060, Thermal, Belabet and Caucus, teams up to defeat the alien Xlerii. Everything's out in the open now, except for the mysterious surprise waiting deep in the sub-basement of the hospital where Thermal was being held. How many secrets does the past hold for Cal Carson? In the Torch of Liberty backup feature, the final chapter the origin of the red, white, and blue champion of the American way is revealed.
