Mr. A is a fictional comic book hero created by <a href="../SteveDitko/Ditko.html">Steve Ditko</a>. Unlike most of his work, the character of Mr. A remained the property of Ditko, who wrote and illustrated the stories in which the character appeared entirely himself. The character first appeared in Wallace Wood's witzend #3 (1967). Ditko has been quoted as saying that his creation, The Question, is a comics-code acceptable version of Mr. A. Mr. A was inspired by the belief system and moral absolutism of the philosopher-novelist Ayn Rand.

Rex Graine is a newspaper reporter for the Daily Crusader. He is known for his uncompromising principles and incorruptibility. In order to fight crime, Graine wears metal gloves and a steel mask that resembles a placid face, thus becoming Mr. A. In keeping with the hardboiled detective theme, both personae typically wear suits and fedora hats; Mr. A's outfit is completely white. There is no origin story for the character, thus the only discernible reason why Graine sometimes disguises himself (both his identities are equally threatened by criminals and sometimes hated by the general public) is due to his choice to become a vigilante. Mr. A uses half white-half black calling cards to signify his arrival, as well as to represent his belief that there can only be good and evil, and no moral grey area.

Comics creator Alan Moore was once a member of a band the Emperors of Ice Cream which performed a Moore-penned song entitled "Mr. A." (to the tune of the Velvet Underground's song "Sister Ray") parodying Steve Ditko's political ideology. Moore later created the character Rorschach for the series Watchmen, which was based on both The Question and Mr. A. Moore related a story about an unspecified acquaintance who said he asked Ditko about whether he was familiar with Rorschach. Reportedly, Ditko acknowledged Rorschach as being "like Mr. A except insane".
