Cover by MARKO DJURDJEVIC. Written by RICK REMENDER. Art by JEFTE PALO. Launching from the pages of New Avengers, Jericho Drumm assumes the role of Marvel's new Sorcerer Supreme as DOCTOR VOODOO! 
</p><p>
#1 Having foreseen an unimaginable evil that will soon envelop the Marvel Universe, the Eye of Agamotto has passed the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme on to the one man who has the unique gifts to stave off the coming darkness -- but is Doctor Voodoo ready for the momentous duty as avenger of the supernatural? As Jericho begins to grapple with his colossal new position, malevolent beings of vast power see his arrival as an opportunity to strike. 
</p><p>
#2 Lost, gravely injured and stranded in the low pits of the Everdimensions, Doctor Voodoo is hunted by a brutal living nightmare that holds a festering and contagious self-doubt. Was Jericho given the mantle of Sorcerer Supreme in order to leave our dimension vulnerable to the great evil Agamotto foresees? Or is he the one man with the strength to suppress the coming darkness? The Loas do not listen, the Vishanti cannot answer -- alone Jericho must decide if he is fit to serve. He will soon learn... 
</p><p>
#3 The evil which Agamotto foretold has seeped into Earth and amassed an army of possessed children of the supernatural -- all former candidates to the mantle Sorcerer Supreme! Jericho's journeys through the Everdimensions, in hopes of halting this darkness, have left him broken, near death. With help out of reach and the fabric between our world and the shadow planes corrupted, Doctor Voodoo alone must defeat an army of Earth's most powerful lords of the arcane and their unnamed master! 
</p><p>
#4 Nightmare has claimed Earth. His unreal universe of pain and terror has been made tangible and spread across the globe by an army comprised of the world's most powerful supernatural beings. Negating the sacrifice of a former Sorcerer Supreme, Jericho Drumm has opened the long-sealed gateway to Bondy√® to ask the Voodoo Loa's for aid. However, what he finds in the strange god land may very well shatter his world forever! 
</p><p>
#5 Nightmare has used the most powerful supernatural relics in the Everdimensions to spread his infection of terror and fear across our plane of existence. With Jericho Drumm lost, can his brother Daniel live up to the station of Sorcerer Supreme? Can he accept the aid of the only other human left untainted by the Nightmare's curse? Who dares to trust Doctor Doom? You'll never believe who emerges victorious from this supernatural battle royale told in the mighty Marvel fashion!
