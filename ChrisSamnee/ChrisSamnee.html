Chris Samnee is an American comic book artist. He received the 2011 Harvey Award for Most Promising Newcomer for his work on the Thor: The Mighty Avenger, and won a 2013 Eisner Award for Best Penciller/Inker for his work on The Rocketeer: Cargo of Doom and Daredevil. He was also nominated for the 2006 Russ Manning Most Promising Newcomer Award.

Samnee uses 300 series two-ply Strathmore Bristol board. He does not use non-photo blue pencils or any other equipment purchased at speciality stores for preliminary sketching, but uses .9 mm mechanical pencils that he purchases from Target. For inking he formerly used a sable hair Rafael 8404 number 3, 4, and 5, but found that he was able to produce convention sketches more quickly with implements that could be easily stored in pencil bags or pencil boxes, like brush pens, which eliminated the need to clean brushes and the worry about spilling ink, and eventually began using these tools for his professional work as well. 
</p><p>
The brush pens he uses include Zebra and Kuretake models, though most of his work is with a Pentel color brush, whose synthetic hair and refillable, squeezable barrel allows Samnee to controls the amount of ink on the brush. According to Samnee, this implement feels similar to a dipped brush, but does not require cleaning, and allows him the convenience to work wherever he wants.
