About: Typical deliberately confusing Marvel. Marvel NOW! is a comic book branding for the relaunch of several ongoing comic books published by Marvel Comics, that originally debuted in October 2012 with new #1 issues. The relaunch also included some new titles, including Uncanny Avengers and All-New X-Men. Described as a shifting of the Marvel Universe following the conclusion of the "Avengers vs. X-Men" storyline, Marvel NOW! entailed changes to both the publishing format and the universe to attract new readers (sales). 
</p><p>
Publishing changes included new creative teams for each of the titles and the in-universe changes included changes to character designs and new storylines. It marked the next stage of the Marvel ReEvolution initiative, which began in March 2012. The original run went through several waves before coming to an end in May 2015 at the start of the "Secret Wars" storyline. A second Marvel NOW! debuted in 2016 following the "Civil War II" storyline.
