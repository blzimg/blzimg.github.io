Jackson "Butch" Guice (1961) is an American comics artist who has worked in the comics industry since the 1980s. Guice began his career with fanzine work and "designing patches and emblems for a small company in North Carolina." His first credited comics work was penciling and inking the independently published The Crusaders #1 (November 1982), although he had previously ghosted for Pat Broderick on Rom Annual #1 (1982). On the strength of his fanzine work Marvel editor Al Milgrom offered him a tryout on the toy-spin-off title Micronauts. Referring to Rom Annual #1 and Micronauts #48 (Dec. 1982), he remarked that "both were breaking points for me getting into comics".

Guice continued penciling Micronauts until #58 (May 1984). In July 1983, "The Butch Guice Portfolio" appeared in the pages of Marvel Fanfare #9, and Guice contributed to The Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe, Chris Claremont and Bill Mantlo's X-Men and the Micronauts four-issue miniseries as well as occasional issues of a number of different titles. In 1984, he drew the Marvel Comics adaptation of Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom and inked Dazzler. In 1986, he penciled X-Factor, while concurrently contributing pencils to The New Mutants. In 1988â€“89, Guice produced a series of covers for the Quality Comics/Fleetway 2000 AD reprint-title 2000AD Showcase, while penciling the Iron Man title for Marvel. In 1989 he became the artist on Doctor Strange, Sorcerer Supreme.

Guice's cover for Doctor Strange #15 (March 1990) used Christian music singer Amy Grant's likeness without her permission, leading to her management filing a complaint against Marvel Comics, saying the cover gave the appearance she was associating with witchcraft. A US District Court sealed an out-of-court settlement between Grant and Marvel in early 1991, with a consent decree that Marvel did not admit to any liability or wrongdoing.
