Thomas Starling Sullivant (1854â€“1926) was an American cartoonist who signed his work T. S. Sullivant. His work appeared most frequently in the pages of the humorous Life magazine. Best known for his animal and ethnic caricatures, he also drew political cartoons and comic strip toppers, and illustrated children's books. He drew in a heavily cross-hatched pen-and-ink style, with humans and animals depicted with greatly exaggerated features that are nevertheless firmly rooted in his understanding of correct anatomy.

In 1886, when Sullivant was 32, his first published cartoons appeared in the minor humor magazine Truth. The following year, he surfaced in the leading humor publication <a href="../Puck/Puck.html">Puck</a>, and his work was also in other periodicals, including Harper's Weekly and Texas Siftings. Soon he was seen in the pages of Life with his "Aesop to Date" series and other cartoons.
