Condorito (Little Condor in Spanish) is a Chilean comic book and comic strip since 1949, that features an anthropomorphic condor living in a fictitious town named Pelotillehue—a typical small Chilean provincial town. He is meant to be a representation of the Chilean people. Originally published by Zig-Zag, currently by United Press Syndicate.
</p><p>
Condorito was created by the Chilean cartoonist René Ríos, known as Pepo. Despite his Chilean origin, Condorito is very popular throughout Latin America, where the character is considered part of the general popular culture. Condorito and his friends appear in a daily comic strip.
</p><p>
The structure of Condorito is very simple: each page is an independent joke, without any continuity with others (though some jokes are larger or shorter than one page). Some of the details included in the artwork are gender-dependent, but the humor is usually couched in double-entendres that children would be unlikely to understand. 
</p><p>
Main characters include (but not nearly all characters listed):
<ul>
<li>Condorito, the main character, Condorito is an anthropomorphic condor, lackadaisical and unambitious, but also kind, loyal, friendly and ingenious. Always a picaresque character, he is a sort of antihero who solves his problems using his wit, not his talent or work. 
</p><p>
<li>Yayita: Condorito's "fashionable eternal fiancée." She loves him but hates his reluctance to discuss marriage.
</p><p>
<li>Don Chuma: Condorito's best, most loyal friend, he is a tall, thin, kind man who helps Condorito to solve some of his problems, especially the ones related to money. 
</p><p>
<li>Pepe Cortisona, a.k.a. "Saco de Plomo", "Lingote", and "Jetón" ("Sack of Lead", "Ingot", "Big Mouth") an extremely unbearable and dense character that no one can bear, Condorito's nemesis.
</p><p>
<li>Coné: Condorito's young nephew (an orphaned relative he took in). His name comes from when Condorito presented him to the Civil Registry, and he wanted to name him "Ugenio" (Ugene), but the civil servant insisted in writing the correct form "Eugenio" (Eugene), crying out loud "¡Con E!" ("With an E!") several times, so Condorito finally accepts to call him "Coné".
</p><p>
<li>Yuyito: Yayita's tomboyish niece and Coné's best friend and partner in crime.
</p><p>
<li>Don Cuasimodo and Doña Tremebunda Vinagre: Yayita's fat, grumpy and overprotective parents, who reluctantly tolerate their daughter's engagement with Condorito and secretly support Pepe Cortisona as a better candidate for their daughter's hand. 
</p><p>
<li>Garganta de Lata ("Tin Throat"): A tall, jolly, thin redhead with a typical alcoholic's nose. He spends most of his time at the "Bar El Tufo" ("The Stench Bar") or sleeping off a hangover in the street, which makes his wife and friends very upset.
</p><p>
<li>Ungenio Gonzalez: A not-so-smart pal of Condorito. He has white hair; a long nose; and big teeth, reminiscent of a donkey's teeth, from which a drip of drool usually hangs. He has a son, Genito, who is almost identical to him. "Ungenio" is a play on words, as it resembles the actual name Eugenio and as "un genio" ("a genius") which Ungenio is not.
</p><p>
<li>Huevoduro ("Hard-Boiled Egg"): A potbellied, egg-headed, completely white character whom Rios claims is based upon a very pale, bald Canadian ambassador. Like Don Chuma, Huevoduro is often a straight man to Condorito in the strips.
</p><p>
<li>Chuleta: A tall, thin, jolly man with huge teeth, long sideburns, a thin mustache and green skin. ("Chuleta" is Chilean slang for "sideburn").
</p><p>
<li>Don Máximo Tacaño ("Most Stingy"): A humorous miser who would rather die than part with his money and does all kinds of ridiculous things just to save money or avoid buying things, even if he really needs them.
</p><p>
<li>Padre Venancio: Pelotillehue's Roman Catholic priest, presumably (because of his haircut) a Franciscan.
</p><p>
<li>Comegato ("Cat Eater"): A friend of Condorito who has a feline face and wears a beret and a black turtleneck. As his name suggests, he frequently hunts and eats cats, much to his friend's disgust.
</p><p>
<li>Cabellos de ángel ("Angel Hair"): Big-nosed, half-shaven and potbellied, his hair is like a sea urchin. He is very delicate about it and will quickly defend his style if there's a suggestion he should change it. 
</p><p>
<li>Chacalito ("Little Jackal"): A criminal character, usually seen in jail or on trial for his crimes, which range from stealing to homicide. His name is ironic, since he appears to be the biggest, strongest man in town.
