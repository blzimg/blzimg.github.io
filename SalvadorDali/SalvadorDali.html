Salvador Dali was a prominent Spanish surrealist born in Figueres, Catalonia, Spain.
</p><p>
Dali was a skilled draftsman, best known for the striking and bizarre images in his surrealist work. His painterly skills are often attributed to the influence of Renaissance masters. His best-known work, The Persistence of Memory, was completed in August 1931. Dali's expansive artistic repertoire included film, sculpture, and photography, at times in collaboration with a range of artists in a variety of media.
</p><p>
Dali was introduced to the United States by art dealer Julien Levy in 1934. The exhibition in New York of Dali's works, including Persistence of Memory, created an immediate sensation. Social Register listees feted him at a specially organized "Dali Ball". He showed up wearing a glass case on his chest, which contained a brassiere. In that year, Dal√≠ and Gala also attended a masquerade party in New York, hosted for them by heiress Caresse Crosby, the inventor of the brassiere. For their costumes, they dressed as the Lindbergh baby and his kidnapper. The resulting uproar in the press was so great that Dali apologized. When he returned to Paris, the Surrealists confronted him about his apology for a surrealist act.
