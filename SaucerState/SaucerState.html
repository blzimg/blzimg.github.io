The story of Arcadia Alvarado, former alien abductee (possibly) and current President of the United States, continues, and now that she commands the highest office in the country, sheâ€™ll use her power to find out what really happened. But, even with the power of the Presidency at her fingertips, will she be able to get to the truth? Either way, she will have to act fast as the biggest event in world history begins to unfold around her. 
</p><p>
After last issue's cliffhanger, US President Arcadia Alvarado is acting fast against the biggest event in world history. 'Drop everything, spend everything. Give me a damn gun.' 'It won't be a war. It'll be a slaughter.' 'Isn't that exactly what the post-truth bastards do?'
</p><p>
With a real alien ship a year away from Earth, Arcadia's far right political foes are suggesting something that sounds horribly like revolution. Meanwhile, fairies are offering her ex-husband a cake-for-access deal. No, really. It's the start of a quest that will unlock the secrets of reality as the series takes its unique mixture of House of Cards and Jeff Kripal to... Russia?
</p><p>
How do you use cake to summon something in the desert? Should you? Space Warfare Task Group reports back, and now Arcadia might have a gun in time. There's a grave for someone who's meant to be heading back to Earth. No more damned data. The Russians say something terrible. And Fausto plays the trumpet. It's the White House vs. ufology vs. incoming actual real damn aliens. 
</p><p>
Just a walk with Orthon of Venus, Adamski, the Greys, the Silver Space Lady and our poor Michael across New Mexico, the Saucer State. Secrets are revealed. It all starts coming together. The Chinese Air Force is here too! At what point does astronaut training become worship? At what point does metaphor become fact? Is there a need for flying saucers?
</p><p>
Kidd and Chloe are lost in Hollywood and... under fire?! Astelle has been alien abducted... by Isis? The WW2 origins of the UFO myth are... fake news? And of course, of course, of course, President Arcadia Alvarado is in Moscow, the axis of the story, the axis of recent history, for the season finale of... the human race?
