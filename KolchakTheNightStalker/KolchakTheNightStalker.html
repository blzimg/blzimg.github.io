Kolchak: The Night Stalker is an American television series that aired on ABC during the 1974â€“1975 season. It featured a fictional Chicago newspaper reporter, Carl Kolchak, played by Darren McGavin, who investigated mysterious crimes with unlikely causes, particularly those that law enforcement authorities would not follow up. These often involved the supernatural or science fiction, including fantastic creatures.

The series was preceded by two television movies, The Night Stalker (1972) and The Night Strangler (1973). Although the series lasted only a single season, it remains popular in syndication. In 2018, it aired late Saturday nights on MeTV. 
</p><p>
It is often cited as the inspiration for the popular series <a href="../XFiles/XFiles.html">The X-Files</a>. Following the success of The X-Files, the franchise was resurrected in 2005 in a second television series with a new cast and characters, as well as subsequent novels and comic books. It was a ratings bomb and was quietly cancelled after just six episodes were aired (ten were produced).
