Cartoons and comic strips may have appeared in other parts of the world first, but comic books were born here! Part narrative storytelling, part dramatic illustration, visually arresting, comic books have been part of American culture since 1938. 
</p><p>
From Aargh! to Zap!: Harvey Kurtzman's Visual History of the Comics presents a chronology of the art from the perspectives of one of America's most influential creators of comics characters and comic books. Kurtzman, creator of Mad Magazine, takes a tour through the decades of comics production, from the Spirit of the 1940s to the Dark Knight of the 1990s.
