<p>
The greatest heroes of the Marvel Universe go to war with each other in this all-new super slugfest. From deep space comes the Coiterie, a group of intergalactic samaritans who come to Earth seeking its most powerful champion through all-out combat. But what could possibly make our heroes compete against one another? How about this: the victor receives a miraculous wish of their choice. But as Wolverine, Spider-Man, the Thing, Rogue, Thor, Hulk and a legion of heroes are culled from the Avengers, Fantastic Four and the X-Men, the participants begin to wonder: could their alien hosts really have a more sinister agenda?

This series will bring two new heroes to the Marvel Universe (see Fantastic Four #17 &amp; #18). These brutal bouts are brought to you by writer Chris Claremont (Fantastic Four), penciler Oscar Jimenez (Wolverine: Black Rio) and inker Eduardo Alpuente.
