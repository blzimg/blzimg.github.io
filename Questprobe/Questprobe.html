Questprobe is a trilogy of graphical adventure computer games featuring Marvel Comics characters. The three games are Questprobe featuring The Hulk, Questprobe featuring Spider-Man and Questprobe featuring The Human Torch and The Thing.
</p><p>
Twelve issues were planned, each to promote a computer game from Adventure International with same feature character (new for each book). Comics served as introductions to the games, but were also readable stand-alone. #4, scheduled to feature the X-Men, was cancelled when AI went out of business. But was later printed in Marvel Fanfare (Marvel, 1982 series) #33.

The games were designed by Scott Adams, developed and published by Adventure International and the first was originally released in 1984 for the Atari 8-bit family, Apple II, ZX Spectrum, Commodore 16 and Commodore 64 with the sequels being published each following year. The original plan was for a series of twelve games, but Adventure International's bankruptcy in 1985 brought a rapid and premature end to the line.

The manual of Questprobe featuring the Hulk credits John Romita Sr., Mark Gruenwald and Kem McNair with creating the art, however it is not clear if this is the in-game art, or the artwork in the manual. The manual feature quite detailed images. After this first title in the series, Scott Adams did a major upgrade to his adventure game engine. Because of this, Questprobe featuring The Hulk was much rougher than the subsequent titles in the series. It could only handle two word directions at a time and understood very few terms.

The second Questprobe adventure which featured Spiderman improved on the "verb noun" command interface of The Hulk and allowed fuller sentence inputs. The title also incorporated improved graphics.
