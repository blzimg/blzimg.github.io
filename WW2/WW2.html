Published by New England Comics in 2000, written and drawn by Ron Ledwell. WW2 is a comic book devoted to retelling the climatic battles of World War II in realistic and exciting graphic stories. 
</p><p>
#1 Stalingrad - Here Hitler's armies were bled to death on the dusty steppe of the Soviet Union by Stalin's Red Army. Can Hitler capture Stalingrad before the brutal Russian winter sets in? Can Stalin's forces hold off the panzers and Stuka planes until 'General Winter' comes to the rescue? 
</p><p>
#2 Salerno - The Allied invasion of Italy and inparticular the Battle of Salerno. Where the American 5th Army took to the shores against the intrenched German panzer divisions of Hermann Goering. After a brutal and punishing week long battle the American 5th Army was able to secure its beach head and start their long march up the 'boot' of Italy.
</p><p>
#3 Eastern Front - The strategic movement into the Crimea and the battle of Sevastopol was another one of Hitler’s grand schemes into which he bullied the German General Staff. At its center were the oil fields in the Caucasus, but it was a plan that should have waited until the Russian Forces were soundly defeated.  
</p><p>
#4 Falaise Pocket - It could be said that the Battle of the Falaise Pocket was actually the culmination of many preceding confrontations: Breakout from Normandy, Cherbourg Peninsula, Caen, the Orne River and the Breakout into Brittany. The German generals and the Allied commanders together could never have guessed the outcome of this epic battle, a turning point of World War II. The Allied encirclement of several German armies occurred so quickly that the Wehrmacht was caught without a strategy to cope, nor with any reserves to break open the relatively weak Allied ring. 
</p><p>
The American, British and Canadian forces were also completely surprised by the magnitude of their success; they were unprepared to exploit it. Perhaps one man, U.S. General Patton, had an idea how to exploit this phenomenal achievement—had Supreme Commander General Eisenhower given him a free hand. With their complete dominance of the air, the Allied armies could nave rapidly destroyed the German forces in the pocket and advanced nearly unchallenged all the way to Germany. But the Allied commanders followed military success with extreme caution. They elected to reduce the pocket gradually before moving forward, thus passing up a golden opportunity to end the War in 1944. 
</p><p>
#5 D-Day - June 6 1944. The greatest seaborne invasion force in the history of mankind leaves England bound for the European mainland. Supported by thousands of warships and attack aircraft American British Canadian French and Polish soldiers sit nervously awaiting the order to disembark and land on the heavily defended shores of Normandy. Hitler's favorite Field Marshal Erwin Rommel has spent the last twelve months fortifying the beaches and training his infantry and tank divisions in how to repel troops invading from the sea. Now Rommel's military skill and experience will be put to its greatest test.
</p><p>
#6 Tawara - A battle in the Pacific Theater of World War II that was fought on 20–23 November 1943. It took place at the Tarawa Atoll in the Gilbert Islands, and was part of Operation Galvanic, the U.S. invasion of the Gilberts. Nearly 6,400 Japanese, Koreans, and Americans died in the fighting, mostly on and around the small island of Betio, in the extreme southwest of Tarawa Atoll.
</p><p>
The Battle of Tarawa was the first American offensive in the critical central Pacific region. It was also the first time in the Pacific War that the United States had faced serious Japanese opposition to an amphibious landing. On Tarawa the 4,500 Japanese defenders were well-supplied and well-prepared, and they fought almost to the last man, exacting a heavy toll on the United States Marine Corps.
</p><p>
#7 Afrika Korps - Early in World War II a large Italian Army advanced from Libya into British-occupied Egypt. But the British forces despite being numerically inferior were able to repel the Fascist invaders. In fact they pushed Mussolini's forces all the way back to Tobruk in eastern Libya. Sensing yet another defeat for his fellow dictator Adolf Hitler decided to halt the rout by sending a few 'light' divisions into Africa. 
</p><p>
The Afrika Korps as the force came to be called was supposed to halt the British advance and stabilize the line. But its commander Field Marshal Irwin Rommel had much greater things in mind. Carefully marshalling his meager forces and applying a brilliant mix of aggressive tactics Rommel and his forces drove the British out of Libya and all the way back deep into Egypt. Now looming disaster faced the British: could their exhausted desert forces prevent Field Marshal's conquest of Egypt and Germany's decisive occupation of the Suez Canal?!
</p><p>
#8 Midway - The Pacific Ocean 'Battle Of Midway' is recognized as the crucial 'turning point' of World War II. In the current issue of this 'true-to-life' series on the Second World War writer/artist Ron Ledwell examines this dramatic battle between the navy and air force of Imperial Japan and those of the United States. 
</p><p>
The Japanese sent the cream of their fleet and aviation forces to capture the critical mid-Pacific island of Midway. Due to a miscalculation on the part of the Japanese cammander the American flyers were able to catch the enemy carrier forces unprepared and poorly protected; in 15 minutes 3 Imperial Japanese flattops were burning and sinking with a fourth soon to follow. In a period measured only in minutes Japanese fortunes in the Pacific were completely reversed. The defeat of Japan took another 3 years to complete but after Midway American victory in the Pacific war was never seriously in doubt.
