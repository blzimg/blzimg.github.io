The series starts as "The Saga of the Swamp Thing" for the first 38 issues, then changes names to just "Swamp Thing", then changes publisher brands from DC to Vertigo with issue #129.
</p><p>
The Swamp Thing is a fictional character and antihero in comic books published by American company DC Comics. A humanoid/plant elemental creature, created by writer Len Wein and artist Bernie Wrightson, Swamp Thing has had several humanoid or monster incarnations in various different storylines. 
</p><p>
The character first appeared in House of Secrets #92 (July 1971) in a stand-alone horror story set in the early 20th century. The character then returned in a solo series, set in the contemporary world and in the general DC continuity. The character is a swamp monster that resembles an anthropomorphic mound of vegetable matter, and fights to protect its swamp home, the environment in general, and humanity from various supernatural or terrorist threats.
</p><p>
Alan Moore takes creative control and creates a new Swamp Thing story beginning with issue #20 "Loose Ends".
</p><p>
Moore reconfigures Swamp Thing's origin to make him a true monster as opposed to a human transformed into a monster. In his first issue, he swept aside most of the supporting cast Pasko had introduced in his year-and-a-half run as writer, and brought the Sunderland Corporation to the forefront, as they hunted Swamp Thing and "killed" him in a hail of bullets. 
</p><p>
The subsequent investigation revealed that Swamp Thing was not Alec Holland transformed into a plant but actually a form of plant life that had absorbed Holland's body and created a 'copy' of his form and consciousness after exposure to his serum, with Swamp Thing's appearance being the plants' attempt to duplicate Holland's human form. 
</p><p>
Outside of an extensive comic book history, Swamp Thing has inspired two theatrical films, a live-action television series, and a five-part animated series, among other media.
</p><p>
Swamp Thing is a 1982 American science fiction horror film written and directed by Wes Craven, based on the DC Comics character of the same name created by Len Wein and Bernie Wrightson. It tells the story of scientist Alec Holland (Ray Wise) who becomes transformed into the monster Swamp Thing (Dick Durock) through laboratory sabotage orchestrated by the evil Anton Arcane (Louis Jourdan). Later, he helps a woman named Alice Cable (Adrienne Barbeau) and battles the man responsible for it all, the ruthless Arcane.
</p><p>
It was followed by a sequel, The Return of Swamp Thing, in 1989. After her mother's mysterious death, Abigail Arcane (Heather Locklear) travels to the Florida swamps to confront her evil stepfather Dr. Arcane (Louis Jourdan), who had been resurrected after his death in the first film. In an attempt to stave off the effects of aging, Dr. Arcane, assisted by Dr. Lana Zurrell (Sarah Douglas), combines genes from various swamp animals and human beings, creating an army of monsters known as Un-Men. Dr. Arcane tries to use his stepdaughter Abby in his genetic experiments until she is rescued by Swamp Thing (Dick Durock), a scientist previously transformed into a bog creature after a confrontation with the evil doctor.
