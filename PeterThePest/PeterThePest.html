Another Dennis the Menace rip-off, Peter the Pest was a retouched and re-lettered version of Melvin the Monster, the 1956 Dennis rip-off. Even the art tries to look like Dennis. The title changes to "Petey" with issue #4, which does nothing to boost sales so the series is dropped, just like the Melvin series it was based on.
