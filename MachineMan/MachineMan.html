1978: While Machine Man is busy saving the life of a hiker in danger, he is unaware that Dr. Broadhurst is receiving a government agent who is informing him that Colonel Kragg has been assigned to terminate the last surviving X-51 unit. Machine Man walks deeper into the forest where he comes across Peter Spaulding, whose van is struck behind a fallen tree. After MM moves the tree out of the way, Peter offers Machine Man a lift. They make small talk in the van until Machine Man learns that Peter is a psychiatrist and becomes uncomfortable and exits the van in traffic. Using a skateboard built into his feet, Machine Man attracts the notice of the police, who in turn alert the troops of Col. Kragg. Mr. Machine is renamed Machine Man. Story arc continued from 2001: A Space Odyssey #10.
