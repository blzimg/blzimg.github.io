Dalia Messick (1906–2005) was an American comic strip artist who used the pseudonym Dale Messick in order to get noticed. She was the creator of Brenda Starr, Reporter, which at its peak during the 1950s ran in 250 newspapers. Messick began working for a Chicago greeting card company and was successful but quit when her boss lowered her pay during the Great Depression.

In 1933, she moved to New York City where she found work with another greeting card company at a higher salary, $50 a week, sending nearly half of it back to her family in Indiana. She recalled, "I had $30 a week to live it up. You could walk down 42nd Street and have bacon and eggs and toast and coffee and hash brown potatoes and orange juice—the works—for 25 cents."

She was inducted into the <a href="../Awards/Awards.html">Will Eisner Award</a> Hall of Fame in 2001.
