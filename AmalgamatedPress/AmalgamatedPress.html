In 1888, Alfred Charles William Harmsworth launched his first magazine, Answers to Correspondants. Two years later, he launched his first comic called Comic Cuts, which was followed by titles like Illustrated Chips, The Wonder, Funny Wonder, Puck, Merry and Bright, and Firefly. In 1901 Harmsworth gathered all of his publishing ventures under the name The Amalgamated Press (AP), located at Fleetway House, Farringdon Street, London.
</p><p>
AP was sold to The Mirror Group in 1959 and formed the core of the IPC Magazines line of comics.
