Private investigator John Blacksad is up to his feline ears in mystery, digging into the backstories behind murders, child abductions, and nuclear secrets. 
</p><p>
Guarnido's sumptuously painted pages and rich cinematic style bring the world of 1950s America to vibrant life, with Canales weaving in fascinating tales of conspiracy, racial tension, and the "red scare" Communist witch hunts of the time. 
</p><p>
Whether John Blacksad is falling for dangerous women or getting beaten to within an inch of his life, his stories are, simply put, unforgettable. Dark Horse is very proud to present the first three Blacksad stories in a beautiful hardcover collection, completely relettered to the artist's specifications and with the latest album, Red Soul, in English for the very first time. 
</p><p>
This internationally acclaimed series has won nearly a dozen prestigious awards-including the Angouleme Comics Festival prizes for Best Series and Best Artwork-and is a three-time Eisner Award nominee. Blacksad took Europe by storm in 2000 and sold over 200,000 copies in France alone.
