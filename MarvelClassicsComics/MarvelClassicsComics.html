Marvel Classics Comics was an American comics magazine which ran from 1976 until 1978. It specialized in adaptations of literary classics such as Moby-Dick, The Three Musketeers, and The Iliad. It was Marvel Comics' attempt to pick up the mantle of <a href="https://blzimg.github.io/ClassicsIllustrated/ClassicsIllustrated.html">Classics Illustrated</a>, which stopped publishing in 1971. 36 issues of Marvel Classics Comics were published, 12 of them being reprints of another publisher's work.
