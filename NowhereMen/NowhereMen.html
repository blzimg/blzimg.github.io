Nowhere Men is a comic book series written by Eric Stephenson. The first six issues were drawn by Nate Bellegarde, colored by Jordie Bellaire, lettered by Fonografix (Steven Finch), and published by Image Comics. As of issue 7, Dave Taylor has replaced Nate Bellegarde, who no longer is part of the creative team. Emi Lenox also joined up, providing short comics about Monica Strange, one of the characters of Nowhere Men.

The series centers on a fictional world where a group of four scientists, long since gone their own ways, have had huge cultural influences in a way similar to that of The Beatles in our world. It's loosely based on the story of the British Invasion, especially how The Beatles stood out. The promotional tagline, "Science is the new Rock-N-Roll", exemplifies this.
</p><p>
The name is derived primarily from the fact that things just seem to come out of nowhere for the scientists, although there are other plot points that the name is based on as well. It was also influenced by the Beatles song "Nowhere Man".

Nowhere Men was nominated for four Eisner Awards in 2014, of which it won one: Jordie Bellaire won the award for Best Colorist for her work on several titles, including Nowhere Men.
</p><p>
As of June 2019, eleven issues have been published, the first six of which form the completed first arc. The seventh through eleventh issues are part of the second arc, which started in January 2016 after a two-year delay.
