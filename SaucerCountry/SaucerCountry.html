Saucer Country is a UFO mythology comic book series written by Paul Cornell and drawn by Ryan Kelly, published by Vertigo in 2012 and 2013. The series is about a US presidential candidate, Governor Alvarado, who has come to believe she may have been abducted by aliens. It is a blend of a political environment and stories of aliens and UFOs.
</p><p>
Starting in May 2017, a sequel miniseries, Saucer State, began publication at IDW. Saucer State lasted for six issues, and will have a six issue follow-up miniseries that will serve as a conclusion.
</p><p>
The main plot of Saucer Country is about Arcadia Alvarado, the Hispanic governor of New Mexico now running for presidency. Arcadia believes that she had been abducted by aliens one night, and embarks on a mission to get to the bottom of the mystery while running for the position of President at the same time.
</p><p>
Saucer Country is a trip through UFO mythology, a subject I've always been fascinated with. It's a dark, suspenseful, serious thriller with, I hope, some warm, very human characters at the heart of it. The series also features short stand-alone stories besides the main plot. These stories are "true stories", accounts of people who claim to have been abducted by aliens.
</p><p>
Arcadia Alvarado functions as the governor of New Mexico and is considered to be the primary Democratic candidate for the position of the President of the United States. Arcadia is caught in the middle of a volatile political situation as she is running for Presidency and dealing with her duties as governor at the same time. 
</p><p>
Arcadia also has to deal with her alcoholic ex-husband Michael. However, Arcadia claims to have been "abducted by aliens" one night, but only retains glimpses of her encounter with the extraterrestrial beings and does not remember the entire story. Thus, with the help of her fellow workers and staff, Arcadia tries to solve the mystery about her apparent abduction by the aliens. A former Harvard professor, Professor Kidd, is also keen on getting to the bottom of Arcadia's claim.
