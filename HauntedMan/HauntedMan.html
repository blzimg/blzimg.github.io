Someone seems to have stolen a chunk of the Haunted Man's memories, until he discovers the far more heinous truth! The Daylight Savior, a greedy Ohio physicist, is stealing pieces of the past and selling them to rich nostalgia addicts in his extra-dimensional cloud-city, Ex Tempore. When he makes off with all of 1974, the world is thrown into a chaos of confusion: how did Gerald Ford get into the White House, and where the hell did disco come from? It's up to the Haunted Man and Margaux (the cyber- journalist who's desperate to learn the truth beneath Haunted Man's plastic face) to defy time, Nazis, and '50s suburbanites, to give the new millennium back its past.
