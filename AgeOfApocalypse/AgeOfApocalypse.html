1995 by Marvel<br>
<p>
This whole mess is a comic book crossover storyline published in the X-Men franchise. It spans different years since 1995 and so far has not stopped and it getting worse now that the movie story line is getting into it. Because it is such a stupid mess I'm only going to touch on it in this one page.
</p><p>
Officially the Age of Apocalypse briefly replaced the universe of Earth-616 and had ramifications in the main Marvel Comics universe when the original timeline was restored. It was later retconned (reto-actively connected) as having occurred in the alternate universe of Earth-295. 
</p><p>
The truth is timeline just makes no sense. X-Men was so hot they blew out as much as they could as fast as they could and it really doesn't tie together at all. They started splitting into other times and universes, and made trade paper back (TPB) collections and reprint and different cover variants, and now it is a jumbled mess of junk. If it was good, I might try to sort it all out.
