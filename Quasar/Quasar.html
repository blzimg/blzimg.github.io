Quasar is the name of several fictional superheroes in the Marvel Comics universe. With the exception of Neutron, all of them have worn the Quantum Bands, advanced ancient alien technology that enables the wearer to wield awesome power.
</p><p>
The Quasars' powers are derived from the pair of Quantum Bands fused to the bearer's wrists (or more specifically, from the seven gems on each of the bands). The bands are permanently affixed to the wrists; while he or she can make light bend around them so they appear to be invisible, they are still tangible. 
</p><p>
They are linked to their wearer's nervous system and grant tremendous powers of energy manipulation, apparently working the same for each bearer. Composed of unknown materials, the bands were originally created by Eon to be worn by his designated Protector of the Universe. 
</p><p>
At some point they were left in a weapons depot by the alien Kree, where they were discovered by the Uranian Eternals and brought to Earth by the deluded Crusader, who believed himself to be the 1950s Marvel Boy.
</p><p>
Foremost among the bands' powers is the ability to tap into a limitless energy source called the "Quantum Zone". Quasars can project quantum energy in the form of devastating beams of force or heat. Vaughn more commonly employs them to fashion incredibly durable constructs of solid energy, such as containment spheres or pincers. He protects himself with a personal force field of quantum energy.
