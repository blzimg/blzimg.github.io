Wolverine is a number of Marvel Comics comic book series starring the X-Men member Wolverine. As of April 2013, 323 issues and 11 annuals have been published. It is the original flagship title created for the character.
</p><p>
The first Wolverine was a limited series written by Chris Claremont with pencils by Frank Miller, inks by Joe Rubinstein, letters by Tom Orzechowski, and colors by Glynis Wein. Marvel Comics published the series from September to December 1982. This story arc covers the events leading up to Wolverine's engagement to Mariko Yashida.
</p><p>
An ongoing series started publication in 1988 and lasted until 2003 when it was relaunched after issue 189. The original creative team consisted of writer Chris Claremont and penciler John Buscema. Claremont described the series as "high adventure rather than super heroics, sort of a combination of Conan meets Terry and the Pirates." As a visual manifestation of the series' break from the traditional superhero genre, throughout Claremont's run Wolverine wears either civilian clothes or a mask-less, all black outfit instead of his superhero costume, and costumed characters in general were few and far between. Nearly half of the series's run was written by Larry Hama.
</p><p>
As part of the "Dark Reign" storyline, the series was renamed Dark Wolverine in 2009 with issue #75 and starred Wolverine's son, Daken. The third volume ended with issue #90.
</p><p>
A fourth volume was launched in September 2010 with a new #1. After issue 20 the series returned to its original ongoing numbering as issue #300.
</p><p>
How Marvel reached issue #300: Volume 2 (#1-#189), Volume 3 (#1-#75/190-264) Wolverine: Weapon X (#1-#16/265-279) and Volume 4 (#1-#20/280-299), with Volume 4 issue #21 ending up as #300.
</p><p>
It concluded with issue #317 in December 2012 in the wake of the Marvel NOW! initiative.
</p><p>
As part of the Marvel NOW! relaunch, Wolverine Vol. 4 was cancelled as of issue #317 and a fifth volume was launched in March 2013, with the creative team of Paul Cornell and Alan Davis.
</p><p>
An additional series titled Savage Wolverine debuted in January 2013. The title features team-ups between Wolverine and other Marvel superheroes.
</p><p>
A sixth volume of Wolverine by Paul Cornell and Ryan Stegman was launched as part of All-New Marvel NOW! initiative in February 2014, featuring a changed Wolverine, who has joined a group of minor super villains as an attempt to simplify his life.
