Invincible is an Image Comics Universe series named for its superhero, "Invincible" ("Mark Grayson"). Created by writer Robert Kirkman and artist Cory Walker and illustrated by artist Ryan Ottley, Invincible first appeared in Tech Jacket #1 (November 2002), before graduating to his own self-titled regular series in 2003, as the premier title in Image's then-new superhero line.

Invincible is the son of Omni-Man, an extraterrestrial superhero of the Viltrumite race. Invincible inherited his father's superhuman strength and ability to fly and he has sworn to protect the Earth. As a teenager he had trouble adjusting to his newfound powers and coping with the reality of his origins.
</p><p>
Markus Sebastian Grayson is the son of novelist Nolan Grayson, who is the superhero Omni-Man, and Deborah Grayson. When Mark was seven years old, Nolan reveals that he is a member of a race of peaceful aliens called Viltrumites, that he had come to Earth to help mankind and that one day Mark would develop super powers. Mark's powers manifest at the age of 17 while he is working at his part-time job. His powers, which increase with use, are: super strength, speed, flight, some invulnerability and fast healing.
