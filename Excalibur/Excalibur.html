"The Sword is Drawn" Shadowcat is fast asleep when she is suddenly awoken to a barrage of hands patting makeup on her and grabbing her out of bed and dressing her in her outfit. She walks out of her dressing room and finds she is on the set with the X-Men in a studio by Mojo. She cannot believe her friends are alive.

She walks over to Psylocke and sees that she has no eyes. She steps back and all the X-Men act as if they are not themselves. Shadowcat does not understand but soon runs across Rachel Summers who is attacked by the rest of the X-Men and bound. Shadowcat goes to touch her and phases her out of her bonds. Phoenix blasts out of the room. Shadowcat turns to see the X-Men are really wolves in disguise and the director, Professor X, tells his pack of Warwolves to attack. Shadowcat screams, trapped against a wall. She then wakes up and realizes it was all just a dream.
