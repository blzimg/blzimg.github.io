Is Bob Fingerman a cynical misanthrope or a disappointed humanitarian? Dare we suggest maybe both? In You Deserved It, the sensitive creator of the acclaimed graphic novel Beg the Question accesses his darker side, serving up this caustic collection of comical cautionary chronicles. What Beg the Question was to sex and romance, You Deserved It is to wanton violence and social wrongness.

From Otis Goes Hollywood, the epic saga of a homicidally puritanical meat packer with dreams of making it big in Hollywood, to Missing Pieces, a yarn about the extracurricular activities of paramedics, to Buying Bologna, about a guy who just really, really loves his luncheon meat, to Yiffy Situation, a fuzzy fable about fornicating Furries, You Deserved It serves up enough yarns to make one hilariously misanthropic sweater, all in living-and dying-color!
