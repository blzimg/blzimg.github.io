Fired from a cushy job in Silicon Valley, Lexy becomes a coder for New Romancer, an Internet dating app that's seen better days. To create fake profiles, she plunders characteristics from history's most notorious lovers. Using little-known writings by Ada Lovelace, the world's first computer programmer, Lexy pushes the boundaries of coding and accidentally unleashes history's greatest lover: Lord Byron. Online dating meets courtly love in this paranormal rom-com by Vertigo veteran writer Peter Milligan and rising art-star Brett Parson (Tank Girl).
