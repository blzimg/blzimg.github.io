About: In 1983 Marvel Comics released an A-Team title which ran for 3 issues. Due to the huge popularity of both comics and The A-Team show at that time, information which lists this as a "3-issue mini-series" is probably accurate. They were often released together as a set in a plastic bag also collected as the A-Team Storybook.
