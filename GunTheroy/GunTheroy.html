Harvey is a contract killer who surfaces only to cap fools and get paid like a ghost cutting a bloody swath through the living world, invisible and therefore untouchable. But now, the ghost is being haunted by someone from the real world, a woman whom Harvey simply can't get out of his head. A woman who's made Harvey so damn crazy he just might decide that living is worth the risk of dying.
