Evil Ernie, an undead psychotic killer, is a fictional comic-book character created by writer Brian Pulido and artist Steven Hughes in 1991 and originally published by Eternity Comics, then the imprint shifted hands in 1993 to <a href="../ChaosComics/ChaosComics.html">Chaos! Comics</a> and then Devil's Due Publishing in 2005. Evil Ernie is currently published by Dynamite Entertainment in their purchasing of the Chaos! Comics imprint. 
</p><p>
Ernest Fairchild is the root or core of Evil Ernie. Ernest Fairchild was a young boy who possessed the supernatural power to sketch scenes which would later come to pass, for instance he drew him and his family together with a little brother of his and several months later his mom became pregnant with their second son.

Ernest's parents sought to "cure" him of his abilities and brought him to Dr. Leonard Price, who had been working on a device dubbed the Dream Probe. Price, not knowing about the abuse Ernest was suffering, submitted him to his device, which sent him to the Endless Graveyard, where he met <a href="../LadyDeath/LadyDeath.html">Lady Death</a> who turned him into Evil Ernie.
