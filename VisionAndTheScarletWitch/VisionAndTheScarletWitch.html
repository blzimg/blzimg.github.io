The Vision and the Scarlet Witch is the name of two limited series published by Marvel Comics. They starred Vision and the Scarlet Witch, two long time members of the Avengers.

1982 Series: Jarvis helps Vision and the Scarlet Witch move into their new house in Leonia on Halloween and delivers a Druid Tome that Captain America had found. Escaping the Tome, Samhain mutates several trick-or-treaters (Jack O'Lantern, Goblin and Ghost) and has them attack Jarvis and Vision. Samhain confronts the Scarlet Witch and reveals to her that he has been worshipped throughout history and that he is the "Eternal Embodiment of All Hallows Eve". Wanda defeats him by burning the Druid Tome. Robert Frank arrives, claiming that he's Wanda's father.

1985 Series: In this second series, the Scarlet Witch gets pregnant by magical means and delivers two sons. Englehart tried to keep the series self-contained, and made the characters resign from the Avengers to avoid having to stick to their events. He also omitted the theme of the racism towards mutants, considering that it was already dealt with at the X-Men's own comic. The comic book was more focused on family drama than superhero exploits. Magic was also a common topic, but it was toned down in comparison with Englehart's run with Dr. Strange. Englehart lamented that the Scarlet Witch's motherhood did not stick, as the kids were killed shortly after he ended writing the character.
