Michael Golden is an American comics artist and writer best known for his late-1970s work on Marvel Comics' The Micronauts, as well as his co-creation of the characters Rogue and Bucky O'Hare. His work is known to have influenced the style of artist Arthur Adams. After starting his illustration career in commercial art, Golden entered the comics industry in late 1977, working on such DC Comics titles as Mister Miracle and Batman Family.

His first work for Marvel Comics was "The Cask of Amontillado", a backup story in Marvel Classics Comics #28 (1977) adapting an Edgar Allan Poe short story. In 1978, he collaborated with Bill Mantlo on Marvel's Micronauts which he illustrated for the series' first 12 issues. He drew a number of Marvel series throughout the 1970s and 1980s, including Doctor Strange, the Howard the Duck black-and-white comics magazine, and Marvel Fanfare. Writer Chris Claremont co-created Rogue with Golden in The Avengers Annual #10 (1981). At Continuity Comics, Golden and writer Larry Hama introduced Bucky O'Hare in Echo of Futurepast #1 (May 1984).

Back at Marvel, The 'Nam series was launched in 1986 by Doug Murray and Golden. Golden drew covers for the licensed series G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero, Rom, U.S. 1, and The Saga of Crystar. Golden also penciled parts of the Marvel No-Prize Book . In the early 1990s, Golden was an editor for DC Comics and later in the decade served as Senior Art Director for Marvel Comics. In the 2000s, he drew covers for DC Comics' Nightwing, Superman: The Man of Steel, and Vigilante. Golden's work was also appropriated by Glenn Danzig as a logo for his bands Samhain and Danzig.
