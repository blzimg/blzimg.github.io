Witness the seduction of Stephen Strange by the mad sorceress Electra. When Strange finds that his servant Wong has been kidnapped, he has but one choice: relinquish his mystic power to gain his freedom. From the arcane shadows of the Sanctum Sanctorum to the dizzying spires of the mystical city of Ditkopolis, Dr. Strange must risk all to maintain the title of Sorcerer Supreme. Script by Marc Andreyko. Art and cover by P. Craig Russell.
