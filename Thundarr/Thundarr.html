Thundarr the Barbarian is an American Saturday morning animated series, created by Steve Gerber and produced by Ruby-Spears Productions. The series ran for two seasons on ABC from October 4, 1980 to October 31, 1981, and was rerun on NBC in 1983.
</p><p>
Thundarr the Barbarian is set in a future (c. 3994) post-apocalyptic wasteland divided into kingdoms or territories,  the majority of which are ruled by wizards, and whose ruins typically feature recognizable geographical features from the United States, such as New York City, Los Angeles, Las Vegas, the Badlands, Mount Rushmore, San Francisco, Washington, D.C., Cape Canaveral, and the Grand Canyon. Other episodes with recognizable settings are set in Mexico and London. 
</p><p>
Another notable feature of this future Earth is that the Moon was broken in two pieces. The shattered moon and the ruins of the former human civilization were caused by the passage of a runaway planet between the Earth and the Moon in 1994, which, from scenes shown in the opening sequence, caused radical changes in the Earth's climate and geography. However, by the time period in which the series is set, the Earth and Moon seem to have settled into a new physical balance. Earth is reborn as "New Earth", as world "savagery, super-science, and sorcery", and far more chaotic than "Old Earth" (the show's name for the preapocalyptic world).
</p><p>
The hero Thundarr, a muscular warrior, whose companions include Princess Ariel, a formidable young sorceress, and Ookla the Mok traveled the world on horseback, battling mostly evil wizards who combine magical spells with reanimating technologies from the pre-catastrophe world. Some of these malevolent wizards enlist the service of certain mutant species in doing their bidding.
</p><p>
Thundarr's weapon of choice, the Sunsword, projects a blade-like beam of energy when activated, and can be deactivated so that it is only a hilt. The Sunsword's energy blade can deflect other energy attacks as well as magical ones, can cut through nearly anything, and can disrupt magical spells and effects. The Sunsword is magically linked to Thundarr and as such, only he can use it.
</p><p>
The series was the creation of Steve Gerber. Gerber and friend Martin Pasko were having dinner in the Westwood area one night during the time Gerber was developing the series. Gerber commented to Pasko that he had not yet decided upon a name for the wookiee-like character the network insisted be added to the series, over Gerber's objections. As the two walked past the gate to the UCLA campus, Pasko quipped, "Why not call him Oo-clah?" Pasko later became one of several screenwriters also known for their work in comics, such as Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, to contribute to the show. After writing several scripts, singly and in collaboration with Gerber, Pasko became a story editor on the second season. Other writers included Buzz Dixon and Mark Jones.
</p><p>
Comic book writer-artist Jack Kirby worked on the production design for the show. The main characters were designed by fellow comic book writer-artist Alex Toth. Toth, however, was unavailable to continue working on the show, so most of the wizards and other villains and secondary characters that appear on the show were designed by Kirby. He was brought onto the show at the recommendation of comic writer Steve Gerber and Mark Evanier.
</p><p>
The heroes and villains all shared an impressive animation and comic book pedigree, with the likes of Mark Evanier (Dungeons &amp; Dragons cartoon, Garfield &amp; Friends) Steve Gerber (Man-Thing, Howard The Duck), Roy Thomas (Writer of most Conan works in the 70's and 80's), Gerry Conway (Punisher, Power Girl), Gil Kane (Artist for both major comic companies and co-creator of the Hal Jordan Green Lantern) and most of all, comics titan Jack Kirby, whose work on The New Gods, Kamandi and OMAC were direct inspirations for much of Thundarr's look and feel.
</p><p>
Noted characters seen in the series include :
</p><p><ul>
<li>Gemini, a literally two-faced being whose evil face evoked no less than Kirby's Darkseid.
<li>The Brotherhood of Night, a group of werewolves who could transform others into werewolves by their touch.
<li>Stalker from The Stars, a predatory, malevolent cosmic vampire.
<li>Groundlings, an intelligent rat-like race.
<li>Carocs, an intelligent crocodile-like race.
<li>Sabian, Ariel's evil stepfather and slave-master to the two male heroes.
<li>Mindok, a disembodied brain, one of the ancients, seeking an android body. Over the years, Mindok learned the ways of magic. It is said he is immortal.
<li>Argoth, the wizard with one thousand eyes. Argoth can see in 360 degrees around him. His eyes are the sources of his power, as all of his spells come firing out of them.
<li>Morag, a life-thief using piracy to gain victims (Voiced by Alan Oppenheimer).
<li>Styria, a witch who commanded humanoid sharks.
<li>Infernus, an evil wizard ironically needing the heroes' protection against the Werewolf Chieftain Zevon (who was likely named after 'Werewolves Of London' singer Warren Zevon). 
<li>Zevon himself may or may not have been a wizard; in the end, while all other werewolves cured reverted to Human, Zevon was revealed to have once been merely an ordinary wolf. How he achieved his hybrid form is not known. His very touch was all that was needed to pass on lycanthropy, and then those of his converts.
<li>Showlow, Basim, Skorpos and Chom - Wizards engaged in a contest (resembling a race like the Wacky Races or Cannonball Run) the heroes unwittingly become pawns in near the ruins of Las Vegas and Hoover Dam.
<li>Khromm (Also the name of a prominent god in Conan) a time-traveling wizard threatening a group of Humans in Fort Alamo.
<li>Kublai, a wizard near San Francisco, who used another barbarian to fight Thundarr while seeking an artifact that could be used against him.
<li>Skullus is nothing more than a head living inside of a glass dome. But donâ€™t let that lull you into a sense of security as Skullus commands one of the largest armies in the world.
<li>Octagon, a tentacled wizard at war with Skullus.
<li>Circe, a cursed witch who switches bodies with Ariel and who may have been the Circe of legend.
<li>Sarott, who sought a device that could restore a miniaturized city of evil-doers to serve as his army.
<li>Yando, who raced a depowered Thundarr to a restorative pool.
<li>Artemus, a weapon-master and opportunist who framed a friend of Thundarr's for theft.
<li>Vashtarr, who sought to prevent a prophecy concerning his downfall.
<li>Zogar, a ruthless mercenary and bounty-hunter with a Power Trident.
