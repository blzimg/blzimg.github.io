"It wasn't meant to be a secret..." I get it all the time now. I just arrived in Portugal, in Lisbon, to promote CORALINE, and the first question I was asked, in the car from the airport to the hotel was 'So, can you tell me anything about 1602?' And I said, 'I saw a photocopy of the first issue and it looks pretty good.' 'Yes, but the story .... What's it about?' 'Oh, you know,' I said. 'Stuff.' 'Well, is it the Marvel characters? Or characters you invented yourself?' 'Yes,' I said. 'That's pretty much it.' 'But how long is it?' 'I think it'll be eight issues. It was meant to be six, but I'm writing episode 5 right now, and there's a lot of story to tell.'

'So why is it such a secret...?' It got to be a secret because the idea of 1602 was fairly straightforward, and really fun, and I hated the idea of people being familiar with it, even bored of it, by the time it came out. So I asked Joe Quesada if he'd mind if we didn't make a big announcement at the start.

But the more people asked me, buttonholed me, pleaded with me, the more I liked the fact that only a tiny handful of people at Marvel and I had even seen Andy's amazing pencils or Richard's colours. This was starting to be a genuinely fun secret - like not telling someone what their birthday present is until it's time to unwrap it.

What am I going to tell you? It's really fun. It's set in the Marvel Universe. It looks gorgeous. You may even like it. There are sixteen hundred and two good reasons for telling you all about it, and I'm not saying a word. Think of it as your birthday present."
