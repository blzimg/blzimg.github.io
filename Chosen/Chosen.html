Imagine you're a 12 year old suddenly discover that you are the returned Jesus Christ. You can turn water into wine, make the crippled walk again, and perhaps even raise the dead. What do you do, what does your family do, and how does it affect you knowing that you're destined to grow up and take part in a conflict that people have been awaiting for almost two thousand years? The Chosen has been described in the British press as Spider-Man meets the Book of Revelation. SFX magazine describes it as Harry Potter for Christian fundamentalists. This Dark Horse Comics mini-series is part of the creator-owned Millarworld line of books from writer Mark Millar and artist Peter Gross.
