First appearence in Marvel Comics #1 (1939), title series of 38 issues from 1940-1954 by Marvel Comics.
</p><p>
The Human Torch is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.  The original Human Torch was an android created in 1939 by writer-artist Carl Burgos for Marvel Comics' predecessor company, Timely Comics. The Human Torch, also known as Jim Hammond, first appeared in Marvel Comics #1 (Oct.1939), published by Marvel's predecessor, Timely Comics. 
</p><p>
The "Human" Torch was actually an android created by scientist Phineas Horton. He possessed the ability to surround himself with fire and control flames. In his earliest appearances, he was portrayed as a science fiction monstrosity, but quickly became a hero and adopted a secret identity as a police officer for the New York City Police Department. The Human Torch was one of Timely Comics' three signature characters, along with Captain America and Namor the Sub-Mariner. Like many superheroes, the Human Torch fell into obscurity by the 1950s.
</p><p>
The current character is a founding member of the Fantastic Four. He is writer Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby's reinvention of the similar, previous character, with the same name and power, but not the same. The current Human Torch is named Johnny Storm.
</p><p>
Like the rest of the Fantastic Four, Jonathan "Johnny" Storm gained his powers on a spacecraft bombarded by cosmic rays. He can engulf his entire body in flames, fly, absorb fire harmlessly into his own body, and control any nearby fire by sheer force of will. "Flame on!" which the Torch customarily shouts when activating his full-body flame effect, has become his catchphrase.
