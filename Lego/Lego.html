LEGO A/S, doing business as The LEGO Group, is a Danish toy production company based in Billund. It is best known for the manufacture of LEGO-brand toys, consisting mostly of interlocking plastic bricks. The LEGO Group has also built several amusement parks around the world, each known as Legoland, and operates numerous retail stores.

The company was founded on 10 August 1932 by Ole Kirk Christiansen. The brand "LEGO" is derived from the Danish words "leg godt", meaning "play well". In the first half of 2015, The LEGO Group became the world's largest toy company by revenue, with sales amounting to US$2.1 billion, surpassing Mattel, which had US$1.9 billion in sales. On 11 August 2017, LEGO announced that Niels B. Christiansen would become the new CEO, effective 1 October of the same year.

The history of LEGO spans nearly 100 years, beginning with the creation of small wooden playthings during the early 20th century. Manufacturing of plastic LEGO bricks began in Denmark in 1947, but since has grown to include factories throughout the world. In 1961, LEGO was managed by Samsonite until 1972 in the United States and 1986 in Canada.

The Lego Movie is an Danish-American media franchise based on Lego construction toys. It began with the 2014 film of the same name, which was directed and written by Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. The success of the film led it to receiving two licensed video games, a theme park film ride attraction, two spin-off films which were released in 2017, an animated series that also came out in the same year as well as a sequel in 2019 among other pieces of media.
