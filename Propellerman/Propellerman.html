The future. A tired world of economic collapse and ecological disaster. In this corporate-dominated world, a living weapon escapes to blaze a trail of destruction as it searches for its creator. A solitary figure watches from the rooftops. Propellerman. Does the creature provide some clues to his missing memory?
Propellerman discovers a key to his missing memory inside a city-destroying monster and must evade a squadron of helicopters in order to protect it. Human brains attached to computers may fill in the missing pieces of Propellerman's memory -- if he lives long enough to discover their secrets. Before he can understand who he is, Propellerman must face the Manipulator!
