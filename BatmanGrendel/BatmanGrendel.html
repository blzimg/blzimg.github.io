<p>
Pits the relentless determination of the Dark Knight Detective against the diabolic methodology of Hunter Rose, the first incarnation of Matt Wagner's now-classic creation, Grendel. 
</p><p>
While Bruce Wayne and Hunter Rose play power games in Gotham's high society, Batman finds himself up against a new and vicious foe of uncanny intellect and evil intent, one more than capable of testing the Dark Knight's formidable skills to their limits.
</p><p>
The true aggressive evil of Grendel is revealed as, in his malevolent quest to prove his superiority over Batman, he slaughters a squad of Gotham City cops and kidnaps an innocent child to use as a pawn in his cruel games of duplicity and murder. But the Dark Knight is not so easily duped, and Grendel's extreme actions set them both up for a chilling confrontation!
