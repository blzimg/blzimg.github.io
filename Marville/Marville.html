Marville is a 2002 comic book limited series published by Marvel Comics. The series was written by Bill Jemas, and the stories involve satirical comments on comic book industry conventions and trends.

The main character is Kal-AOL Turner, the son of Ted Turner and Jane Fonda from 5002. In the year 5002, Ted Turner and Jane Fonda sent their infant son of eighteen years back to the present in a time machine made of Playstation 1 parts. Despite having no superpowers, he tries to be a superhero. After some adventures as a Superhero, he and his friends decide to use their time machine to travel back to the origin of time and talk to God. Jack (who is never definitively stated to be God) takes Al and his friend through the times of the dinosaurs and neanderthals, explaining the origins of life and bestowing the secret of world peace to Al in the process. Al tries to have his story published as a series of comic books to share the secret of world peace, but is rejected because his story is not about superheroes or action.

The title is a reference to the TV series Smallville; the cover of issue #1 features the main character tied up as a scarecrow with a red 'M' painted on his chest, much as Tom Welling is in the first episode of Smallville and in related publicity material.
