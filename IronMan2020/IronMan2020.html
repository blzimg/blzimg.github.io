The armor is familiar, but the man inside isn't who you'd expect! He's Arno Stark, the cold and hard-hitting Iron Man of the future - and Tony Stark's descendant has quite a legacy to live up to. Catch all the futuristic action as Arno battles Spider-Man and Blizzard in a time-traveling adventure to stop a nuclear terrorist; faces Machine Man at the behest of Tony's old foe Sunset Bain; and clashes with the original Death's Head, industrial saboteur Wellington Marcus and the high-flying Commodore Q! Can Arno overcome his foes - and himself - to become the hero he's modeled himself after?
