If you thought the Age of Apocalypse was the end of her story, think again! Following the events of BLINK, Clarice finds herself joined together with a mysterious band of heroes on a mysterious world on a mysterious quest... picking up on the mystery part yet? 
</p><p>
So who are these characters? What is their connection to the X-Men? And just what is their mission? All we can say is that this series will explore not just X-Men continuity, but that of the entire Marvel Universe, and each issue will feel like a WHAT IF?... except the danger will be all too real!
