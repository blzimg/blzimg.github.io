Epic's creator owned Heavy Hitters premieres a new title, with a cover embossed with metallic ink. </p><p>
The fabric of reality is unraveling, threatening the worlds of Lester Girls, Spyke, Feud, and Jugger Grimrod. Only Lawdog can stop the interdimensional mad-scientist Jaeglom and his dreaded devices from reducing the worlds of the Heavy Hitters to nothingness. But will he be in time?
</p><p>
This thrilling frame story binds together five high-octane tales in the Heavy Hitters Annual, with Lawdog, Feud, Alien Legion, Lester Girls (from The Trouble With Girls), and Spyke all staring in their own adventures. All feature the wide-open and slightly off-center humor of the Heavy Hitters series, and big colorful art by the Epic crew.
