Bill Griffith (1944) is an American cartoonist who signs his work Bill Griffith and Griffy. He is best known for his surreal daily comic strip Zippy. The catchphrase "Are we having fun yet?" is credited to Griffith. Griffith began his comics career in New York City in 1969. His first comic strips in the East Village Other and Screw featured an angry amphibian named Mr. The Toad.
</p><p>
Griffith ventured to San Francisco, California in 1970 to join its burgeoning underground comix movement and gained prominence in it, first with a hit comic Young Lust, "an X-rated parody of girl's romance comics." and co-created with cartoonist <a href="../JayKinney/JayKinney.html">Jay Kinney</a>. Other early major comic book titles included Tales of Toad. 
</p><p>
He co-founded the influential comics anthology <a href="../Arcade/Arcade.html">Arcade: the Comics Revue</a> with Art Spiegelman and co-edited for its seven-issue run in the mid-1970s. Griffith has worked with the leading underground publishers throughout that decade and up to the present: <a href="../PrintMint/PrintMint.html">Print Mint</a>, Last Gasp, Rip Off Press, Kitchen Sink and Fantagraphics Books. He contributed comics and illustrations to a variety of publications, including National Lampoon, High Times, The New Yorker, The Village Voice and The New York Times. 
</p><p>
The first Zippy strip appeared in the underground Real Pulp #1 (Print Mint) in 1971. The strip went weekly in 1976, first in the Berkeley Barb and then syndicated nationally through Rip Off Press. The one-row format Zippy strip debuted in the Berkeley Barb in 1976 and continues in weekly newspapers. 
</p><p>
In 1979, he added his alter ego character, Griffy, to the strip. He describes Griffy as "neurotic, self-righteous and opinionated, someone with whom Zippy would certainly contrast. I brought the two characters together around 1979, perhaps symbolically bringing together the two halves of my personality. It worked. Their relationship seemed to make Zippy's random nuttiness more directed and Griffy's cranky, critical persona had his foil, someone to bounce happily off of his constant analysis of everything and everyone around him."
