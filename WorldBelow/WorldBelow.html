Fifteen years ago, from a hole in the ground in rural Washington, a tiny flying machine emerged and Charles Hoy found it. From all appearances, this small vehicle wasn't built with any existing human technology and Hoy made a fortune selling that technology to the first eager customer. 
</p><p>
Now with his fortunes dwindling and his curiosity piqued with more than a decade of questioning, Hoy has hired a team of adventurers to enter this vast, underground realm in hopes of bringing back even greater discoveries. But while the team expects the unexpected and is prepared for danger, nothing they can imagine will prepare them for The World Below.
</p><p>
With The World Below, Paul Chadwick-creator of the internationally acclaimed Concrete-delivers a fever-dream hybrid of classic rip-roaring science-fiction adventure and quirky, unsettling psychological drama. Chadwick's unsurpassed storytelling skill and eye for detail and realism make The World Below a journey unlike any other.
