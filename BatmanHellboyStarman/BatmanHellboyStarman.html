Illustrator: Mike Mignola, Writer: James Robinson
<p>
In one of the most unorthodox crossovers to date, DC's Dark Knight meets Mike Mignola's Hellboy! Ted Knight comes to Gotham City to lecture at a conference on alternative energies sponsored by Wayne Industries. 
</p><p>
But when Knight is kidnapped by a group of magic-wielding Nazis called the Knights of October, Hellboy offers his aid to Batman to help find Ted and thwart the Knights of October in their plans to marshal the Golden Age Starman's knowledge for their own nefarious purposes. 
</p><p>
As the heroes track the kidnappers and their victim to the Amazon jungle, they'll need some additional help: from Ted Knight's son Jack, Starman.
