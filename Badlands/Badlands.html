It's 1963, and Camelot reigns in the White House. In Chicago, a car thief named Connie Bremen is fresh out of Joliet and fresh out of luck. 
</p><p>
Severed from his past, shadowed by a sadistic ex-cellmate and famed for murder, Bremen is caught up in a maelstrom of sex, violence and conspiracy that forces him south... to Dallas, death and destiny. It's 1963 and America is about to die.
