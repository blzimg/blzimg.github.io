Heaven can wait. Hell can't. From the pages of THE SANDMAN comes LUCIFER, a new ongoing VERTIGO series starring the ultimate rebel. When fallen angel Lucifer Morningstar asked Dream of the Endless to sever his wings so he could walk among mortals, the former Lord of Hell thought he was making the right decision. But managing a piano bar in L.A. has lost its charm, and now the darkest star in the City of Angels is ready to get back in the game. Only this time he'd rather play God.
