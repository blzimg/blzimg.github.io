Story: The story is of Ningen who was sent on his way by his Master. While he searches for the meaning of life, he happens upon a man that tells him that he will only find the answer to the question once heâ€™s killed 365 samurai. His journey progresses through the seasons and the art pulls you along where the dialogue fails to. And when he reaches the end he does find an answer.
</p><p>
When Ningen leaves his dojo at the request of his master to travel the world and grow as a swordsman he embarks on a journey that becomes a metaphor for the cycle of life and every human's possibility for spiritual growth.
