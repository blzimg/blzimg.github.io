Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey is a  1991 American science fiction comedy film, and the directing debut of Pete Hewitt. It is the second film in the Bill &amp; Ted franchise, and a sequel to Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure (1989). Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter and George Carlin reprise their roles. The film's original working title was Bill &amp; Ted Go to Hell and the film's soundtrack featured the song "Go to Hell" by Megadeth, which Dave Mustaine wrote for the film. Despite mixed reviews from film critics, like its predecessor, the film has since gained a cult following. Box office earned $38 Million.

 In addition to the films, the franchise has spawned both an animated television series (with Winter and Reeves reprising their roles) and a live-action television series in 1990 and 1992 respectively, video games, and comic books.
