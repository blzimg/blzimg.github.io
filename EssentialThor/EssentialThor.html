Soaring from the pages of Journey Into Mystery, the adventures of Thor were unlike anything comic book readers had seen before. Here was the longhaired, hammer-wielding god and his family and friends from legendary Asgard. Here were Frost Giants, dragons and Loki the trickster. Here was a host of villains that typified the over-the-top sensationalism of the day, such as the Carbon Copy Man, the Tomorrow Man and Sandu, Master of the Supernatural! Here were bonus 'Tales of Asgard,' which retold Norse myths in the Mighty Marvel Manner.
