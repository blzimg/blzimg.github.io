This one-shot anthology tells three tales from the darker side of the Marvel Universe. The first, “Expressway to Hell” features Cloak &amp; Dagger as they attempt to help runaway teens who have fallen into the clutches of drug dealers. In doing so, they were attempting to prevent the same sort of fate that befell them when they ran away from home years before and were forced to take an experimental drug that killed numerous kids, but gave them their strange powers.

The second story, “Desiring Martine,” explores the loss that Michael Morbius experienced since becoming a living vampire. Here, he watches his former fiancée, Martine, and realizes that the life they once might have had together is truly gone.
</p><p>
Finally, “In Stone” features Isaac Christians, a man trapped in the body of a stone gargoyle, who is reminded that underneath his cold exterior beats the soul of a man.
