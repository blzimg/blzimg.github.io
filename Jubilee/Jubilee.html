Join Jubilee, everyone's favorite wisecracking mutant firecracker, in her new adventures on the left coast! Living in the X-Mansion was a trip, but now she's found where weirdos really come out ? Los Angeles! But it won't be all fun and games as she contends with an overbearing aunt, a principal who wants her expelled and a mutant gang-leader who just may have the hots for her. Jubilee is an all-ages, new-reader-friendly romp that will get you in touch with your mall mojo!
