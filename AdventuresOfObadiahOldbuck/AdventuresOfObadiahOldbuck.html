Histoire de Mr. Vieux Bois published in English as The Adventures of Obadiah Oldbuck, is a 19th-century publication written and illustrated by the Swiss caricaturist Rodolphe Töpffer. Published first in Europe in 1837 as Histoire de Mr. Vieux Bois, and then in the United States in the 1840s as the book The Adventures of Mr. Obadiah Oldbuck, published by Wilson &amp; Co., followed by a September 14, 1842, newspaper supplement of that name. It is sometimes referred to as the first comic book.

The format consists of sequential pictures with captions, aka "text comics", rather than utilizing the staple of word-balloons, a convention that would later be developed in newspaper comic strips. In Understanding Comics, comics theorist Scott McCloud says Töpffer's work is in many ways "the father of the modern comic." McCloud emphasizes Töpffer's use of "cartooning and panel borders" along with "the first interdependent combination of words and pictures seen in Europe."

Mr. Vieux Bois encounters young woman and instantly falls in love. His initial attempts at courting are ignored, followed by short periods of his desperation. He attempts suicide by falling on his own sword and then by hanging himself. Both attempts fail.
</p><p>
He discovers a rival suitor and challenges him to a duel. He is better with his dueling sword and his rival has to flee. Vieux Bois contacts the parents of his girlfriend, seeking her hand in marriage. He returns home and starts to celebrate loudly. His celebration ends with his arrest for disturbing the neighbours. The marriage is called off and he feels suicidal. He asks for hemlock but is given herb soup instead.
