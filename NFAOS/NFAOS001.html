Issue #1, First appearance of Scorpio in "Who Is Scorpio?"<br>
Fury sneaks into an island fortress, only to get shot in the back. Surprise!; It's an L.M.D., and the shooter is the real Fury!; But on examination, Dugan informs Fury the L.M.D.'s been shot 4 times, not 3 - which means, someone tried to assassinate him!; The only clue is a tiny badge with a "Scorpio" symbol on it.

In San Francisco, comic Flip Mason's on the run from gambling debts; In Kansas City, racketeer Mitch Hackett looks forward to joining the mob. In NYC, Fury &amp; Val walk in the rain; At the Monza Autodrome, Count Julio Scarlotti wins a race - and we see he has a Scorpio tattoo on his wrist.

Days later in Nevada, Fury helps test an "EPB G-System" (Entrope Phase Barrier Guard System), a force field which is hoped may one day protect entire armies. As SHIELD prepares one final test (with an H-Bomb!) we see the tech firing the missile has a Scorpio tattoo on his wrist; Fury suddenly realizes the EPB's down, and nobody answers his comm; He races across the desert to a rocket sled used by NASA to escape as the missile descends on the spot he was relaxing; At the U.S. Government Research Center in Las Vegas, everyone's been put to sleep with gas by Scorpio - when Fury arrives via motorcycle.
