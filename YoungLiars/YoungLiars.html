<p>
Young Liars is a comic book series created by David Lapham. It was published by DC Comics as a part of that company's Vertigo imprint. The first issue was released in March 2008.
</p><p>
The book centers around a group of 20-somethings in modern-day New York City, though the story quickly expands to other parts of America and the world. All of them have disturbing secrets about themselves that they keep from the others, and even the readers are left to decide what is true and what are lies.

It is unclear whether the title was taken from, or is in reference to, the popular 2003 album, Young Liars, by the American band, TV on the Radio.
