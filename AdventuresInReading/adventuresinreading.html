Story:<br>
The Amazing Spider-Man was in the middle of a pitched battle with a heavy called the Troglodyte. The battle eventually spread to a public library where Spider-Man and three nearby youths were caught in the Troglodyte’s transporter ray. The transporter, affected by various books in the library, sent the group on a wild ride through time and space. 
</p><p>
The group found themselves caught up in the story "worlds" of such books as "Ivanhoe," "That Was Then, This Is Now," "War of the Worlds," and "The Jungle Book." It’s a rather spectacular way to make literature come alive, which is exactly the point of this free comic to promote books and libraries.
