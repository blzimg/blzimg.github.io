1 Omibus collection in 1993 Dark Horse created by Richard Delgado.
</p><p>
The series originally consisted of two comics, which are set in the Mesozoic era: Tribal Warfare, from 1993, and The Hunt, from 1997. Both are very violent stories about the daily lives of carnivorous dinosaurs. A third series, The Journey, began November 2009, with a fourth, "Ancient Egyptians", debuting June 2015. Tribal Warfare, The Hunt, and The Journey have been collected in Age of Reptiles Omnibus, Volume 1.
</p><p>
Tribal Warfare<br>
A pack of Deinonychus get revenge on Blue Back, a Tyrannosaurus who stole their well-earned meal, by stealing all of his family's eggs but one.
The story can best be described as a sort of "gang-war" between the two species, and while many of the animals depicted in Delgado's story did not exist at the same time period or place, their inclusion was added for familiarity and dramatic effect.
</p><p>
The Hunt<br>
After a mother Allosaurus is killed by a pack of Ceratosaurus, they begin to chase her son. Eventually, the son grows up and takes his revenge.
The second book is more of a tale of revenge, but features a similar "species vs. species" rivalry. It is noticeably less violent than the first book, featuring a comparatively small amount of gore.
</p><p>
The Journey<br>
The Journey was published in 2009-10. It tells the sprawling migration of a herd of dinosaurs.
</p><p>
The Body<br>
"The Body," an eight-page short story, was published in Dark Horse Presents #4. It concerns what happens to a dinosaur's body after it dies. 
</p><p>
Baby Turtles<br>
"Baby Turtles," an eight-page short story, was published in Dark Horse Presents #3 in oct. 2014. It features the journey of baby turtles to the seas of Cretaceous North America.
</p><p>
Ancient Egyptians<br>
Ancient Egyptians is set in prehistoric Africa. It features Spinosaurus as the protagonist, and the first installment came out on June 3, 2015. It was concluded in September 2015.
