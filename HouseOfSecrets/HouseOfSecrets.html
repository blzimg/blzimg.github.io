The House of Secrets is the name of several mystery, fantasy, and horror comics anthologies published by DC Comics. It is notable for being the title that introduced the character Swamp Thing. It had a companion series titled House of Mystery.
</p><p>
The original Silver Age series ran 80 issues, from November/December 1956 to September/October 1966. In addition to short, "one-off" stories, several issues featured the adventures of modern-dress sorcerer Mark Merlin who first appeared in issue #23 (August 1959). 
</p><p>
The dual-personality super villain Eclipso ("Hero and Villain in One Man!") was created by Bob Haney and Lee Elias and was introduced in issue #61 (August 1963) and continued to the series' end. Prince Ra-Man the Mind-Master bowed in #73 (July–August 1965) and was a Doctor Strange-style "replacement" for Mark Merlin.
</p><p>
Prince Ra-Man twice battled Eclipso.  The "Prince Ra-Man" feature ended in House of Secrets #80 (September–October 1966), the final issue of the series. Other, lesser continuing features included "Peter Puptent, Explorer"; "Dolly and the Professor"; "Doctor Rocket"; and "Moolah the Mystic".
</p><p>
The series was revived three years later with a definite article as The House of Secrets, beginning with issue #81 (Aug.–Sept. 1969). Now its horror and suspense tales were introduced by a host named Abel, who would also host the satirical comic Plop!. 
</p><p>
His brother Cain hosted House of Mystery. Swamp Thing first appeared in House of Secrets #92 (July 1971) in a stand-alone horror story set in the early 20th century written by Len Wein and drawn by Bernie Wrightson. The woman appearing on the cover of this issue was modeled after future comics writer Louise Simonson. The Patchwork Man, a character from the Swamp Thing ongoing series, was to have become an ongoing feature in the series but only appeared in one issue.
</p><p>
The revival of House of Secrets, sporting many covers by Neal Adams, Bernie Wrightson, and Michael Kaluta, ran through issue #154 (Nov. 1978), with six months passing between #140 (February–March 1976) and #141 (August–September 1976). It was then 'merged' into The Unexpected with issue #189, through issue #199. The series was 68 ad-free pages, allowing all three portions to be full-length issues.
</p><p>
The House of Secrets also came to be the name of the actual edifice in which Abel lives. Writer Mike Friedrich and artist Jerry Grandenetti introduced the house and explained its origins. The Sandman series revealed it exists both in the real world of the DC Universe and in the Dreaming, as a repository for secrets of all kinds.
</p><p>
DC's Vertigo imprint revived the name House of Secrets as a new title and concept. Here the House of Secrets was a mobile manor, appearing in different places. The building itself is haunted by the Juris, a group of ghosts who summon those with secrets in order to judge them and pass sentence. 
</p><p>
To the Juris, all offenses carry the same weight, from rape and murder to simply lying at a crucial moment. A runaway named Rain Harper stumbled upon the House of Secrets and took up a position as an unwilling witness to the Juris trials, validating the judgments and either condemning the tried souls to imprisonment in the basement, or setting them free to live their life purged of their secret.
</p><p>
Starting fresh with a new #1 (October 1996), this series ran 25 issues, plus a two-part House of Secrets: Facade special. This House of Secrets series was creator-owned except for its title which was "licensed" by DC to the series' creators. The letters column in issue #6 indicates that for legal reasons, they could not include Cain and Abel in the stories. 
</p><p>
This series was used for the framing story in the first Vertigo Winter's Edge special, featuring Rain happening upon an art gallery in the house whose paintings allow her to see stories from The Sandman, The Dreaming, Hellblazer, The Invisibles, The Books of Magic, The Minx, Sandman Mystery Theatre and Nevada.
