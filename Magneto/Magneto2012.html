The X-Men are shaken when Magneto finally goes villain again. The Master of Magnetism is caught on video murdering members of an anti-mutant group. Then, fresh from that brutal and public crime, Magneto forms a new Brotherhood of Evil Mutants - and the membership will shock you! Why has Magneto thrown away everything he's earned with the X-Men? Or is this just the only time he's gotten caught? Or is something even stranger going on?
