In memory of his fallen Brotherhood members, Erik used his awesome magnetic might to create the Uncanny Magnetic Men (a band of robots designed to fight for the mutant cause and against the Sentinels). After the creation of the Magnetic Men, Magneto created his own Cerebro in order to locate mutants and help them.
