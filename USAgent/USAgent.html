U.S. Agent is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, usually those starring Captain America and the Avengers. He was created by Mark Gruenwald and Paul Neary and first appeared in Captain America #323 (November 1986) as Super-Patriot. He was later redesigned as a new incarnation of Captain America and, just a few years later, as U.S. Agent. In 2012, U.S. Agent was ranked 29th in IGN's list of "The Top 50 Avengers".

John Walker was born in the fictional town of Custer's Grove, Georgia. He grew up idolizing his older brother, Mike, a helicopter pilot who died in the Vietnam War in 1974. John wanted to live up to the memory of Mike who was idolized by their parents, and so later enlisting in the military, becoming a soldier himself. Unfortunately for John he served during peace time and so never managed to become the hero that he perceived Mike to have been.

After John received an honorable discharge from the United States Army, he was told by a friend about the Power Broker, a mysterious individual who gave people superhuman abilities. Walker and his friend received treatments that granted him superhuman abilities.
