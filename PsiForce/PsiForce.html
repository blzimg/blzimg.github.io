Kathy and Tyrone help Stasi and former CIA agent, Emmett, escape the KGB. They bring her to Sanctuary, which is run by Colby, where she meets Wayne and Michael. Emmett explains to the five teens how they need to protect each other, but Stasi feels that she is placing the others in danger by remaining. She contacts KGB agent Vladimiroff, to turn herself in, but Emmett and the others follow her. During the confrontation, Emmett is killed by Mindwolf. Wayne then leads the others to summon Psi-Hawk for the first time. The Psi-Hawk takes out Mindwolf and the five teens decide to stay together.

Carrying Proudhawk's body, the teens are pursued by the police and C.I.A. on their way back to Sanctuary. Using their powers, the group are able to elude their pursuers, but they are finally apprehended by C.I.A. agents outside of Sanctuary. The agents demand answers, but Wayne has the group create the Psi-Hawk. The teens are all gunned down by the agents, but the Psi-Hawk fights them off, erases all knowledge of the recent events from their minds, and then heals all five teens. Only "the Skipper", a C.I.A. friend of Proudhawk's, is allowed to retain his memories.

Tyrone learns from "the Skipper" that Emmett had mentally “pushed” each of the teens into coming to San Francisco. Wayne leaves but eventually returns due to some form of mental push from the Psi-Hawk. Bert Olson, a PI hired by Kathy Ling's parents, brings her back home to Woodland Hills, CA. Psi-Hawk fails to push her back to San Francisco. Wayne pushes her to meet with the other four teens in an attempt to bring her back to Sanctuary. Kathy refuses, but returns home to find Olson showing her parents photos of her using her powers. Kathy strikes him down with her powers and the other teens arrive to come to her aid. Stasi heals Olson and Wayne erases the memories of Olson and her parents. Realizing she needs the protection of the group, Kathy returns with the rest to Sanctuary.
