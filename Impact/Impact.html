In 1989, after “Night Flight” had ended its nearly decade-long run on the USA Network, Night Flight founder and creator Stuart S. Shapiro released the first issue of his new Impact Video Magazine, a jam-packed, magazine-style VHS home video which promised to feature stories about rap music, political humor and underground artists, among other topics.

In the opening scene of this historic first issue, Impact Video Magazine host actor-director Alex Winter, who that same year would be co-starring with Keanu Reaves in the smash-hit comedy Bill &amp; Ted’s Excellent Adventure — tells us that Impact was &quot;dedicated to the idea that the mainstream media ignores a lot of the exciting and import things in our culture.&quot;
</p><p>
Winter later on says that Impact was “completely unencumbered by good taste,” and, right there on the box art, we see Impact being advertised this way: It’s so good… we can’t show it to our mom!
</p><p>
Back in the day, Stuart Shapiro declared that Impact was his &quot;attempt to capture the exciting, streetwise texture Rolling Stone used to have … only this time around, it will be on video instead of paper.&quot;
</p><p>
The VHS box also claimed that Impact &quot;flexes its First Amendment Muscle and digs deep into the counterculture to unearth exclusive rock footage, shocking performers, vicious political satire, outrageous films, razor-sharp comedy, on-the-edge animation, and much more!&quot;
