Evil Dead 2 is a 1987 American horror comedy film directed by Sam Raimi and a parody sequel to the 1981 horror film The Evil Dead. The film was written by Raimi and Scott Spiegel, produced by Robert Tapert, and stars Bruce Campbell as Ash Williams.

Filming took place in Michigan and North Carolina in 1986, and the film was released in the United States on March 13, 1987. It was a minor box office success, achieving just under $6 million. It garnered positive reviews in which critics praised Raimi's direction and Campbell's performance. Like the original, Evil Dead II has accumulated a cult following. The film was followed by a third installment, Army of Darkness, in 1992 and a television series, Ash vs Evil Dead, in 2015.

The film begins with a simplified recap of the previous film. Michigan State University student Ash Williams and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods of Tennessee. While there, they find the Necronomicon Ex-Mortis, a Sumerian version of the Egyptian Book of the Dead, along with a tape recorder belonging to Professor Raymond Knowby, an archaeologist and the owner of the cabin, who had discovered the book during an archeological dig. 
</p><p>
When the group plays it, Knowby's voice recites an incantation from the book, resurrecting a mysterious, demonic spirit. The spirit hurls itself at Linda through her bedroom window while she is changing and demonically possesses her. She attempts to kill Ash, who is forced to decapitate her with a shovel in self-defense and bury her body.
