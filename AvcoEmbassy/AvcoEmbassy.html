Embassy Pictures Corporation (also and later known as AVCO Embassy Pictures as well as Embassy Films Associates) was an American independent film production and distribution studio responsible for such films as Godzilla, King of the Monsters!; The Graduate; The Producers; The Lion in Winter; Carnal Knowledge; The Night Porter; Watership Down; Phantasm; The Fog; Prom Night; Scanners; The Howling; Escape from New York; and This Is Spinal Tap.

The company was founded in 1942 by Joseph E. Levine, initially to distribute foreign films in the United States. Some of Levine's early successes were the Italian-made Hercules films with Steve Reeves; Godzilla, King of the Monsters! (1956, a much re-edited version of Ishirō Honda's original Godzilla from 1954); and the adaptation of The Thief of Baghdad (1961), also with Reeves in the lead. Embassy also distributed Federico Fellini's film 8½ (1963) and Rick Carrier's Strangers in the City (1962).

In 1963, Levine was offered a $30 million deal with Paramount Pictures to produce films in the vein of his previous successes. Paramount would finance the films and Embassy would receive part of its profits. Under the deal, Levine produced The Carpetbaggers (1964) and its prequel Nevada Smith (1966), which were successes, along with flops such as Harlow (1965), starring Carroll Baker, and The Oscar (1966).

By the 1960s, Levine had transformed Embassy into a production company. Later in the decade, Embassy functioned on its own with many Rankin/Bass animated features, including The Daydreamer (1966) and Mad Monster Party? (1967), and successful live-action productions including The Graduate (1967), The Lion in Winter and The Producers (both 1968).
