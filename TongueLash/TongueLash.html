In a world where Mayan gods are still worshipped, where bondage is a way of life, where time itself is the private domain of the rich and powerful, there are still laws which must be enforced. Meet Tongue and Lash, the most unusual private investigators in comics history. Hired by a nobleman's daughter to check out her father's mistress, the two are framed for murder when the girl is assassinated. Their investigation leads them to a dark conspiracy which could destroy their entire society.
</p><p>
Tongue and Lash's investigation into the murder of the prostitute, Lilac, takes them to the flesh factories of the Begetters, the mysterious genetic engineers who create the Mayan Lords' man-beast slaves. They then must track the real killer into Metatime, a forbidden dimension of time that exists between the shadows of reality.
</p><p>
Defilers of the One-Earth beware! Mayan detectives Tongue/Lash return for another erotic investigation. They are hired by the son of a powerful family, but before they can discover the reason, their client and his wife are found gruesomely murdered. Their search for answers leads them to uncover an Inca plot to steal Mayan technology, and ultimately, a sinister, ancient cult which lies at the center of the Empire.
</p><p>
The dead speak more freely than the living in Tongue*Lash's world -- and they don't lie. The two Mayan detectives finally discover who is behind their client's gruesome murder. Their investigation eventually takes them into Metatime, where they expose a bloodthirsty cult that could shake their world.
