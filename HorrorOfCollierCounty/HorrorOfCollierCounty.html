Welcome to Paradise Falls. A sleepy retirement village nestled in southern Florida, it seems perfect. Fran thought the scariest thing she'd encounter was her mother, but there's a greater evil hiding behind the peaceful fa√ßade. Alligators, stalkers, and nosy neighbors all play a part in making Fran paranoid. The only question is: is she paranoid enough? Clover Honey creator Rich Tommaso joins the Maverick lineup with the first chapter of this creepy new thriller just in time for Halloween! You'll never look at retirees the same way again!

Things seem to be going from bad to worse in Paradise Falls, at least as far as Fran is concerned. She's nearly run over by a truck, discovers she has a stalker, and can't find anything to eat in her mom's kitchen. She can't take much more. But, on the plus side, she has met Mel, the only (relatively) normal person in town. So maybe things are looking up. But then again, what is that on the front porch? Rich Tommaso delivers another chapter in his atmospheric-but-funny new thriller that is not to be missed.
