DC's Dark Knight and Marvel's Man Without Fear team up with an unexpected partner - Daredevil's greatest enemy, the Kingpin of Crime - in Batman/Daredevil: King of New York, a gripping Prestige Format one-shot. What threat could force the Kingpin to work with his sworn foe? None other than Gotham City's master of fear: the Scarecrow! 
</p><p>
The series opens with a seemingly simple heist engineered by the Catwoman - a robbery that gives the Kingpin the weapon he needs to spread fear and anarchy throughout New York, with just a little help from the Scarecrow. But when the Scarecrow double-crosses the Kingpin, threatening his reign over the Big Apple's underworld, the crimelord has no choice but to join forces with Daredevil and Batman as they fight to save the city from slipping into fear-induced madness. But what terrors must all three men overcome to defeat a foe who can instill fear in anyone - even the Man Without Fear?
