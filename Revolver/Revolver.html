Revolver tells the story of Sam, a man who lives each day twice: first in a normal world, and then again in an alternate world which is falling apart. Sam must learn why the second universe exists, and choose which one to live in.
</p><p>
Stuck in a dead-end job with a boss he can't stand and a materialistic girlfriend, Sam rises from a late night of barhopping to discover his whole world has changed. Literally. An avian flu outbreak has killed millions, the nation's infrastructure has crashed and a dirty bomb has destroyed Seattle. 
</p><p>
Forced to go on the run, Sam awakes to a normal world the next day, and to chaos again the day after that. A single constant between the two worlds will undo all the damage, if he can find it, but that seems impossible. In one world, anything goes. In the other, he's out of danger but sleepwalking through life. Which world to choose?
