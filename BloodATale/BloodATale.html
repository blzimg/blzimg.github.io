"Theophany!" The ship glided forward. The sailors' heads lolled from side to side. Skin flaked off, drifted into the bloody sea. Gnarled arms reached out. Empty eyes demanded: Give him to us.

"Uroborous!" And they flew: Without mind, without sky, without movement. And they Flew: Hearts entwined, bodies locked, minds as one. And they flew: Above time, beyond distance, beneath space. And they flew: straight and sure to the Isle of the Dead.
