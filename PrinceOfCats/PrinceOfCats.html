Series: Graphic Novel 2012<br>
Publisher: Vertigo<br>
Written and illustrated by Ron Wimberly<br>
<p>
A hip-hop re-telling of William Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet that focuses on Tybalt (derisively referred to as “the Prince of Cats”) and his Capulet crew as they do battle nightly with the hated Montagues. Set in a Blade Runner-esque version of Brooklyn, PRINCE OF CATS is a mix of urban drama, samurai action and classic Shakespearean theater, all written in iambic pentameter!

After being out of print for four years, the book was re-worked and re-released in 2016.
