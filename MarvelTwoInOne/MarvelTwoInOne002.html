The Sub-Mariner, Wundarr, and Namorita guest star in "Manhunters from the Stars!" <br>
When the stranger named Wundarr falls from the heavens he is discovered by the beautiful Atlantean Namorita, cousin to the Savage Sub-Mariner. A misunderstanding sets the powerful Wundarr against the ever-lovin' blue-eyed Thing. Then, when the Monarch of the Seven Seas shows up, things just get worse from there.
