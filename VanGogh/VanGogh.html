Vincent Willem van Gogh (30 March 1853 â€“ 29 July 1890) was a Dutch post-impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade he created about 2,100 artworks, including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life.

They include landscapes, still lifes, portraits and self-portraits, and are characterised by bold colours and dramatic, impulsive and expressive brushwork that contributed to the foundations of modern art. He was not commercially successful, he suffered from psychotic episodes and delusion, neglected his health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His suicide (shot himself in the chest with a revolver) at 37 followed years of mental illness and poverty.
