Daimon Hellstrom, also known as the Son of Satan and Hellstorm, is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics.
</p><p>
Daimon Hellstrom was born in the fictional town of Greentown, Massachusetts. He is the son of Satan and a mortal woman named Victoria Wingate (his father was later retconned into a demon named Marduk Kurios who was actually the biblical Lucifer, according to the N'Garai. Daimon and his sister, Satana, were trained by their father in the art of magic, tapping into the power granted them by their dark heritage. However, while Satana embraced her heritage, Daimon clung to his humanity. 
</p><p>
When their mother discovered who her husband really was, she was driven mad. Daimon and Satana were separated and put in different homes after his mother was institutionalized and his father banished back to Hell. Daimon grew up in a Jesuit-run orphanage, never hearing a word from his father or sister. He became a professor of anthropology at St. Louis University. He then set himself up as an occult investigator and defender of humanity, battling dark arcane forces, primarily those of his father, under the name of the "Son of Satan", as a demonologist and exorcist.

In his first appearance, Daimon battled Satan and Witch-Woman, alongside Ghost Rider. Soon after that, he began a long association with the Defenders by helping them battle Asmodeus (leader of the Sons of Satannish) and Satannish himself. He also helped the Defenders battle the third incarnation of the Sons of the Serpent. Later, alongside the Human Torch, he battled the Dryminextes. He then encountered Satana for the first time as an adult. Alongside the Thing, he battled Kthara. Alongside Ghost Rider again, he battled Challenger. Hellstrom next battled the Possessor.

After Steve Gerber ceased writing the book, Hellstrom began working at the University of the District of Columbia Parapsychology Department, where he had a friendship with a female professor who was a Wiccan.
