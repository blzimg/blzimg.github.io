Darklon himself is an unstoppable magic bad-ass, the exiled son of dethroned king who’s made a deal with the Space-Devil for the power to seek revenge. At the end of part one of that story, it looks like Darklon’s been betrayed and murdered, his head unceremoniously lopped off while all the demons stand around and laugh at him. But it turns out that’s just part of his “Black Baptism,” a necessary first step to filling his head with BLASPHEMOUS EVIL.
