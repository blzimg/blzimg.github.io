Cover art by John Ridgway. Chiller, script by James D. Hudnall, art by John Ridgway; Marx, an artist, is also a practitioner of magic who is recruited by the Architects to capture an escaped demon; He enlists the aid of Tracy King, a TV news reporter who is the last living descendant of the man who learned how to call up the demon hundreds of years earlier.

Devil's Due Digital: Brian Marx leads a double life. Most people think he's an artist living in Manhattan. Secretly, Brian's a Random Mage, a practitioner of Chaos Magic. Chaos magic, is a modern form of sorcery that allows him to turn ordinary objects into occult devices.
</p><p>
When a construction crew accidentally uncovers a secret tomb where a demon has been imprisoned for over 200 years, Brian's talents are needed to save the day. There's only one problem: The people who hire Brian to catch this demon are the same people who entombed the demon in the first place. As Brian is to discover, their motives are far more sinister than anything a demon could think of.
