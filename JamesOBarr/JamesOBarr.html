James O'Barr is an American comics artist, writer and graphic artist, best known as the creator of the comic book series The Crow. O'Barr, an orphan, was raised in the foster care system. In 1978, O'Barr enlisted in the Marines. While stationed in Germany, he illustrated combat manuals for the military. Before entering the Marines, O'Barr's fiancée, Beverly, had been killed by a drunk driver. While living in Berlin in 1981, O'Barr began work on his comic The Crow as a means of dealing with his personal tragedy. In The Crow, the protagonist, Eric, and his fiancée, Shelley, are murdered by a gang of criminals. Eric then returns from the dead, guided by a supernatural crow, to hunt their killers.

After his discharge from the Marines, O'Barr continued his painting and illustration as well as doing various odd jobs, including working for a Detroit body shop. The Crow sat on a shelf for seven years, but at last he found a publisher with Gary Reed of Caliber Press. The first miniseries was published in 1989. The Crow has since sold more than 750,000 copies worldwide. The Crow was adapted into a successful film of the same name in 1994, which was marred by the tragic death of its star, Brandon Lee, during filming. The film went on to spawn three sequels and a television series.
