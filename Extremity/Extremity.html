<h2>Extremity</h2>

Creator: Daniel Warren Johnson<br>
Series: Graphic Novel<br>
Publisher: Image Comics/Skybound<br>
<p>
Paste named Extremity one of its most anticipated comics of 2017, and for good reason: Space Mullet’s Daniel Warren Johnson has long been one of the comic industry’s best-kept secrets, an “artist’s artist” who hasn’t quite broken through to the wider readership. Extremity, his violent, bizarre Skybound debut, finally rectifies that travesty. 
</p><p>
Like an outer-space Fury Road, Extremity is a bloody, fast-paced tale of tribal warfare in a sci-fi world that never conquered class stratification. And like Fury Road’s George Miller, Johnson thrusts his readers right into protagonist Thea’s revenge-driven conflict at breakneck speed, making for one of the most purely exciting comics in recent memory.
