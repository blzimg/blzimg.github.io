198 pages Published by Outerbridge & Dienstfrey in 1971, and in 1988 by Randomhosue. Written by  Les Daniels, John Peck, Frank Muhly.

With graphic design assistance from Mad Peck Studios, this was one of the first attempts to break down the history of comic books and chart the creative high points for a general audience, and it was also one of the first attempts outside ZAP to try to make comics seem edgy and cool by sticking an “X” in there.

Daniels gets a lot of stuff right. He gives roughly equal time to EC, Marvel, and the ‘60s underground, and provides little primers on the funny animal genre and the birth of the Comics Code Authority.
