Series: TV Show, Toys, Comics<br>
Publisher: Sunbow, Hasbro, Marvel<br>
<p>
Based on the Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light animated television series produced by Sunbow Productions (1987) and the accompanying line of action figures from Hasbro.
</p><p>
Visionaries: Knights of the Magical Light was a science fantasy media franchise consisting of a line of action figures from Hasbro, released in 1987, and its related promotional tie-ins, which included a comic book series published by Star Comics and a half-hour animated television series made by Sunbow Productions in the same year.
</p><p>
The toyline was not very successful, which led to both the series and the comic being cancelled after short runs. The comic lasted only 6 issues, and was cancelled halfway through a four-part storyline. The animated series lasted one season of 13 episodes, and was not picked up for a second.
</p><p>
Visionaries is the only Hasbro property to be produced by Sunbow on their own, without the aid of Marvel Productions. Sunbow used TMS Entertainment in Japan for the overseas animation work for the show.
</p><p>
The story is set on the planet Prysmos, an advanced society where all electronics and complex machinery no longer function and its citizens are forced to rely on ancient magic. The Visionaries are knights who are split into two factions: the heroic Spectral Knights and the evil Darkling Lords. 
</p><p>
Everyone who wishes to gain the usage of magic is invited to a competition by the wizard Merklynn. After surviving traps, dangerous creatures, and each other, survivors are rewarded with unique animal totems affixed to their armor chestplates; these talismans are based on the bearers' individual attributes while allowing them to transform into their specific creatures.
