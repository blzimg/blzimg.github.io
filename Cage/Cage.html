2002 Issue #1: Art by Richard Corben, written by Brian Azzarello. Life on the streets is a high stakes game. There are winners and losers. Those that play by the rules, do so at their own risk, and often pay a price. Who's got their back? There's a man who can set things straight. A specialist. He doesn't come cheap, but if you've got the bank, he's got game. And plenty of it. Some know him as a "Hero for Hire." Some as a "Power Man." For others, he's an urban legend. He's all, and none, of the above. His name is Cage. It's time you got to know him.

Dory Dickens wants justice for her daughter, cut down in her prime in the crossfire of a rapidly escalating gang war. In a sea of corrupt cops and rival gang-bangers, there's only one man with the juice to dispense the kind of street justice Dory craves, and his services don't come cheap. Lucky for Dory, the man called Cage has plenty of reason to play hero in a world where there are none.

2016 Issue #1: Story and art by Genndy Tartakovsky. On the mean streets of Harlem, shoes are big, shirts are large, bottoms are belled and crime is rampant. In the heart of the city, the world's hardest-working, smack-talking, chain-wearing super hero is on the streets and on the case. His rates are reasonable, he's Cage, dig it!

But what happens when he's out of his element, trapped in the jungle a thousand miles from home and hunted by savage beasts that walk like men? Out there, Luke's got a couple of things going for him. First, ain't no cage that can hold Cage! Second, he has good friends. Will Luke, Iron Fist and Misty Knight make it back from the Island of No Return?
