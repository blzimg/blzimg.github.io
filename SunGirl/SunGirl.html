Sun Girl is the name of two super heroines from Marvel Comics.
</p><p>
The first Sun Girl was created by artist Ken Bald and an unidentified writer. She first appeared in Sun Girl #1 (Aug. 1948), published by Marvel's 1940s precursor, Timely Comics. Sun Girl starred in a namesake three-issue series cover-dated August to December 1948.

She subsequently co-starred in stories of the original Human Torch in The Human Torch #32-35 (Sept. 1948 - March 1949), Captain America Comics #69 (Nov. 1948), Sub-Mariner Comics #29 (Nov. 1948), and Marvel Mystery Comics #88-91 (Oct. 1948 - April 1949). She additionally starred in a solo story each in the first two of those Marvel Mystery issues. The Human Torch-Sun Girl story "The Ray of Madness" from The Human Torch #33 (Nov. 1948) was reprinted decades later in Marvel's Giant-Size Avengers #1 (Aug. 1974). Sun Girl appears in flashback in the final two issues of the four-issue miniseries Saga of the Original Human Torch (Aprilâ€“July 1990)

A new Sun Girl debuted in Superior Spider-Man Team-Up #1 and will appear as one of the main characters in the upcoming Marvel NOW! relaunch of the New Warriors.
