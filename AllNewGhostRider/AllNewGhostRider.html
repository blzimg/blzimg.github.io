Released with 6 different covers called variants so all the sucker collectors buy 6 of the same issue. Roberto "Robbie" Reyes is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. He is the fifth Marvel character to use the name Ghost Rider, after Alejandra Jones, Danny Ketch, Johnny Blaze and Carter Slade (also known as Phantom Rider).
</p><p>
Robbie Reyes is a high-school student working as a mechanic at an auto body shop who lives with his developmentally disabled brother Gabe and seeks to get away from the dangerous, gang-riddled streets of East Los Angeles. To that end, he enters a street race, hoping to use the prize money to move themselves away. When mercenaries gun him down while trying to retrieve pills that caused the transformation of Calvin Zabo into the supervillain Mr. Hyde, which had been left in the trunk unbeknownst to Robbie, the teen is revived as a demonic being with a flaming, helmet-like head. He drives off in the car, now similarly ablaze.
</p><p>
Later, the spirit bound to the car introduces itself to Robbie as the ghost of a man named Eli Morrow, who says he had been killed by gang members. Eli offers to help Robbie clean up his neighborhood in exchange for Robbie helping him avenge his death. Robbie becomes a local hero whose fame catches the attention of Johnny Blaze, who travels to Los Angeles to confront the new Rider. Eli is later revealed as Robbie's estranged uncle, a Satanic serial killer who kidnapped and murdered at least 37 people in rituals before being fatally shot by police in 1999. A possessed Robbie later encounters Johnny Blaze who uses the Penance Stare on Eli's spirit.
</p><p>
This new Ghost Rider drives and has a telepathic connection to his 1968 Dodge Charger R/T instead of a motorcycle. He doesn't have a floating head, or a human skull. He is possessed by the spirit of Eli Morrow, a deceased serial killing Satanist who worked for the Russian mob as a hit-man. Despite this, he can still perform abilities similar to his predecessors; he possesses superhuman strength and durability and is able to conjure hellfire, wield a supernaturally strong chain weapon, and banish people to Hell.
</p><p>
The Charger can be driven remotely, and Robbie's Ghost Rider form can pass harmlessly through it, allowing it to drive into foes. The car's trunk, when opened, acts as a portal, allowing the Ghost Rider to transport anything, including people, to any location.
