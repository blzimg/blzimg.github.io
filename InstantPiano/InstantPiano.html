Not a jury in the world would convict these guys of premeditated humor. Instant Piano is the snappiest slap-in-the-face comic to hit the racks in years and presents the most sharp-witted, cynical cartoonists alive. If this one was any more spontaneous it would combust on the shelves! If we told you it was like Milk and Cheese meets Ren and Stimpy meets Why I Hate Saturn we would probably be looking at a lawsuit, so just trust us when we say it's good.
