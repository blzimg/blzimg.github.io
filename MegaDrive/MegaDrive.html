In 2014, Mega Drive released the visionary 198XAD, a darkly cybernetic piece of audio horror that quickly became a cult classic. The recording found spots on lists of the best dark synthwave albums and earned respect from critics, fans, and creators alike. Not content to rest on past successes, Mega Drive proceeded to push into new and increasingly diverse ideas on subsequent releases. For five years, 198XAD stood as a unique and unrivaled sci-fi creation at the origin point of synthwave’s dark side.

In 2019 Mega Drive has returned to the dystopian world of his most acclaimed work with a direct sequel, 199XAD. Fans will immediately be drawn back into the densely woven, detailed environment of the original, as Mega Drive displays an impressive versatility across 12 exceptional tracks. Each one offers a glimpse into a different corner of Mega Drive’s inspired vision of the retrofuture, as 199XAD expertly shifts from the searing artillery fire of “Gun Hag” to patiently atmospheric and cinematic pieces like “Terror Eyes.”

July 2019 Mega Drive’s Thunderous Single, "Gun Hag". The master of cybernetic terror is back with a face-melting new track, "Gun Hag." This is Mega Drive at his best, churning out rapid-fire synths and blistering percussion in the darksynth manifestation of futuristic warfare. "Gun Hag" unleashes four and a half minutes of thunderous audio, offering only slight and calculated breaks in the composition as partial protection from the storm. It’s a triumphant return from one of synthwave’s most celebrated and recognized dark artists, and it signals exciting things to come from the forthcoming full-length album.
