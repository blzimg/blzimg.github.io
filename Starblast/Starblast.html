<p>
A powerful energy source, the Starbrand, was inadvertently brought to our universe by Quasar. Now, the power resides in the body of his friend Kayla, whose greatest wish is to be rid of it forever. Unfortunately for her, it seems like everyone in the galaxy wants the Starbrand for themselves.
</p><p>
A group of alien raiders stage a daring attack on the Watcher, then use their huge spacecraft, the Starblast, to attack the moon. Of course, the entire scheme is just a diversion designed to leave Kayla and the Starbrand defenseless.
</p><p>
The major claim to fame of this comic is its numerous appearances by other Marvel characters. It seems like everyone gets a shot, including the X-Men, Ikarus of the Eternals, Photon and the Avengers, Binary, the New Warriors, Warlock and his Infinity Watch, and even the Russian heroine Darkstar.

Starblast sets the theme of the story, which continues in the regular Quasar series.
