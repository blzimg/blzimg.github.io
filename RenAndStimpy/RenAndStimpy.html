The Ren &amp; Stimpy Show is an American animated series created by John Kricfalusi for Nickelodeon. The series follows the adventures of title characters Ren, an emotionally unstable chihuahua, and Stimpy, a good-natured, dimwitted cat. It premiered on August 11, 1991, as one of the original three Nicktoons, along with Rugrats and Doug.

Throughout its run, the show was controversial for its off-color humor, sexual innuendo, dark humor, adult jokes, and violence. This controversy contributed to the production staff's altercations with Nickelodeon's Standards and Practices department. The show ended on December 16, 1995, with a total of five seasons and 52 episodes.

Ren &amp; Stimpy received mixed to very positive reviews during its original run. It would go on to receive widespread critical acclaim after its run, and has since developed a cult following and had a long-lasting influence on television animation. A spin-off for adult audiences, Ren &amp; Stimpy "Adult Party Cartoon", aired in 2003 on Spike, but was taken off the air along with the rest of Spike's animation block after three episodes.
