Earth settlers on planet Epsilon Bootis (EB) try to wipe out the native Ploo. Communication from earth to EB is only via old TV shows from the 1950's.

Sunoco Firestone has such a talent but doesn't know it. Sunoco falls in love with Maia, a Ploo high priestess, who becomes pregnant with his child. This lands Sunoco in prison for several years for the crime of crossbreeding. War between the settlers and Ploo breaks out. Sunoco finds his talent, opens a communications link with earth, reconnects with Maia, and meets his young son for the first time.
