About: The series continues as Marvel Mystery Comics #2-93 when the title is changed to Marvel Tales in 1949. Then gets brought back in 1999 with a confusing one-shot issue #1 (note Blackstone the Magician being used as a shield and the Blonde Phantom getting out of the line of fire at the bottom).

Story: The Human Torch<br>
After the Scientist's Guild convinces inventor Horton to dispose of his new creation, the Human Torch, clever criminal Tony Sardo figures out a way to use this creation for his own evil purposes.

Timely's first publication, Marvel Comics #1 (cover dated Oct. 1939), included the first appearance of Carl Burgos' android superhero the Human Torch, Paul Gustavson's costumed detective the Angel, and Bill Everett's anti-hero Namor the Sub-Mariner, among other features. The issue was a great success, with it and a second printing the following month selling, combined, nearly 900,000 copies.

Also included were non superheros like Al Anders' Western hero the Masked Raider, the jungle lord Ka-Zar the Great, "Now I'll Tell One", five single-panel, black-and-white gag cartoons by Fred Schwab, on the inside front cover; and a two-page prose story by Ray Gill, "Burning Rubber", about auto racing. A painted cover by veteran science-fiction pulp artist Frank R. Paul featured the Human Torch, looking much different from the interior story.
