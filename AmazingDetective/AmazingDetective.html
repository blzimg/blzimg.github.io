Series: on-going, 12 issues <br>
Publisher: 1950 Timely (Marvel)<br>
<p>
Possibly a comic adaptation of Amazing Detective Cases magazine of the 1940s. Not much is known, nor does anyone seem to know why the series started with #3. Could have been branched off of another series, but no one seems to remember anymore.
