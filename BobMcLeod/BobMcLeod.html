Bob McLeod (1951) is an American comics artist best known for co-creating the New Mutants with writer Chris Claremont. Bob McLeod began his career working in the production department of Marvel Comics in 1973 on a recommendation from Neal Adams. He began penciling and inking for Marvel's Crazy Magazine, doing several movie satires and the "Teen Hulk" strip. He was a member of The Crusty Bunkers inkers while working at Adams' Continuity Studios, and became an inker at Marvel and DC Comics on many series, including The Incredible Hulk, Conan the Barbarian, Legion of Super Heroes, Detective Comics, Wonder Woman, and The New Titans, as well as penciling Star Wars and several Spider-Man fill-ins for Marvel.

McLeod drew the graphic novel and the first three issues of New Mutants and inked a number of subsequent issues. The graphic novel's production overlapped with his honeymoon, and ended up missing its shipping slot because editor Louise Simonson choose to keep her promise to McLeod that he could ink it himself. In a 2008 interview, McLeod looked back on The New Mutants as "one of the most frustrating experiences of my career", recounting having to ink the graphic novel while on his honeymoon and later give up doing pencils on the regular series because he could not keep up with the monthly pace at the time and felt he was producing substandard work. In 1987, he inked Mike Zeck's pencils on the "Kraven's Last Hunt" storyline in the Spider-Man titles. At DC Comics, he was the artist on Superman in Action Comics in the early 1990s including the "Dark Knight Over Metropolis" storyarc.
