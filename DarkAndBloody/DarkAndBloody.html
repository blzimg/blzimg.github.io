Guns, moonshine, monsters-there's a lot going on in the backwoods of Kentucky. Iris Gentry is a war veteran who returned from Iraq to find his options for supporting his family limited. Since they live in a 'dry' county, Iris has turned to running moonshine for his former ranking officer-meaning the men now share crimes at home and abroad. You see, back in their combat days, Iris's regiment got involved in something they shouldn't have, and now a deadly, otherworldly consequence has come looking for vengeance.
</p><p>
Something evil is lurking in the woods, and Armed Forces veteran Iris Gentry is pretty sure it's laying in wait to punish him for his past sins. Given his current job running illegal liquor, he can't turn to the law for help, and they probably wouldn't believe him anyway. That leaves Iris all alone to defend his family when the malevolence shows up on his doorstep wearing a familiar face.
</p><p>
As Iris learns about more killings and how they connect to his days in Iraq, the truth of what happened during his military tour and how that connects him to Ayah is finally revealed. As retribution gets closer, he has to think fast to find a way to keep the monster his violence created from walking through his front door.
</p><p>
Now that Iris's bloody past is exposed and his connection to the mysterious Ayah revealed, there is nothing stopping Ayah from openly seeking vengeance. With Iris sent away on an overnight trip to deliver moonshine, the cursed Iraqi girl goes to Iris's house to take his son. She'll go through anything and anyone to get the child, including Iris's pregnant wife!
</p><p>
The cursed girl Ayah has taken Iris' son Shiloh, leaving Iris no choice but to go after her and confront the demons of his past. To do that, he'll have to bring in the man who was truly responsible for the massacre in Iraq that took Ayah's family from her. If Ayah is seeking an eye for an eye, then it's Eric's head she'll be wanting.
</p><p>
All that fear and dread you've been feeling while reading this series? It's all been building to this, the final showdown between one man and the girl who has come seeking revenge. Iris must not only confront Ayah and the brutal past they both share, but who he is deep down. Is it possible he could save his family from retribution and yet not save his own humanity?
