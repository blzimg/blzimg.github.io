The Warlord is a sword and sorcery character appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics  Created by writer-artist Mike Grell.
</p><p>
Vietnam War veteran and SR-71 pilot Travis Morgan passed through a hole in the Earth's crust while flying over the north pole in 1969 and landed in the underground world of Skartaris, a place strongly reminiscent of Edgar Rice Burroughs's Pellucidar. 
</p><p>
Wielding his .44 AutoMag pistol and joined by Shamballah's Princess (later Queen) Tara, he earned the title "The Warlord" and fought villains such as the evil sorcerer Deimos as well as various kings. He gained various sidekicks such as Machiste, Shakira, a Russian scientist named Mariah and his magic-wielding daughter Jennifer Morgan. In one story arc, Morgan even becomes the U.S. President in the far future.
</p><p>
The Warlord debuted in 1st Issue Special #8 (Nov. 1975). The title lasted 133 issues until Winter 1988. Creator Mike Grell wrote and drew the comic for six years, handing over the art chores after issue #59 (July 1982); he continued writing the series through issue #71 (July 1983).
</p><p>
Although The Warlord has a superficial resemblance to Oliver Queen, he is in reality based more upon his creator Mike Grell who was a former member of the Air Force. Grell is caricatured in The Warlord's first appearance, 1st Issue Special #8 and is clearly sporting The Warlord's signature shaggy goatee. Grell and editor Jack C. Harris made a metafictional appearance in the story "Gambit" in The Warlord #35 (July 1980).
