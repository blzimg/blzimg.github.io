You made the world a better place. You probably didn't realize the significance of your actions at the time, but when you bought Harlan Ellison's Dream Corridor Special you truly changed the fate of the planet. Your purchase was a vote to continue our series of adaptations of Harlan Ellison's stories of the fantastic, and so continue we shall!

This first issue of the new series features enough great creators to stun a police dog, as you can no doubt see from the breakdown above. But in particular, you should pay attention to the adaptation of I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream. This classic is one of the ten most reprinted stories in the English language! John Byrne is the first artist ever to adapt this famous story to the comics medium, and we're proud to run his vision alongside Harlan's original prose
