The big origin issue, revealing the reason behind the war between John Starkweather and Kievyn Karr, and the discovery of Zionite, the alloy that caused World War III and led to the birth of the Tomorrow Knights. Richard Starkweather, leader of the Knights, rushes to the rescue of a kidnapped teammate imprisoned in the vile place New York City has become. They must escape before the oxygen runs out. The Knights face off against Kievyn Karr's mysterious 'Project Rodina' in a climax that may destroy the Soviet Union and one of the Tomorrow Knights.
