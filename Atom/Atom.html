About: The Atom is a name shared by several fictional comic book superheroes from the DC Comics universe. The original Golden Age Atom, Al Pratt, was created by Ben Flinton and Bill O'Connor and first appeared in All-American Publications' All-American Comics #19 (Oct. 1940). He initially had no superpowers; instead, he was a diminutive college student and later a physicist who was depicted as a tough guy, a symbol of all the short kids who could still make a difference. 
</p><p>
The second Atom was the Silver Age Atom, Ray Palmer, who first appeared in 1961. Raymond Palmer, Ph.D. in Physics, was named for real-life science fiction writer Raymond A. Palmer, who was himself quite short. After stumbling onto a mass of white dwarf star matter that had fallen to Earth, he fashioned a lens which allowed him to shrink down to subatomic size. 
</p><p>
Originally, his size and molecular density abilities derived from the white dwarf star material of his costume, controlled by mechanisms in his belt, and later by controls in the palms of his gloves. Much later, he gained the innate equivalent powers within his own body.
</p><p>
The third Atom, Adam Cray, was a minor character present in Suicide Squad stories. The fourth Atom, Ryan Choi, debuted in a new Atom series in August 2006. Another Atom from the 853rd Century first appeared as part of Justice Legion Alpha in August 1999.
</p><p>
Story: When a series of mysterious robberies occur which involve strange highly intelligent plants, Ray Palmer decides to investigate as the Atom when he learns about the strange circumstances from Jean Loring. 
</p><p>
As the Atom, Ray follows Jean as she goes on fact finding about the type of plants that are used, and decides to wait out in a greenhouse to keep a secret eye on Jean. When Jean nods off, Atom notices a group of Dryads that suddenly spring out of the flowers and fly away on petals. 
</p><p>
Atom follows after them and learns that they are under the control of a criminal called the Plant Master, who intends to use his mutated plants to try and take over the world. Trying to stop the Planet Master, the Atom is trapped in a Venus fly trap while the Planet Master leaves with the Dryads to initiate his plan.
