Spinning from the pages of THUNDERBOLTS come Marvel's newest superstars!<br>
Since World War II, they have remained in the shadows, fighting for world stability. They are the V-Battalion, descendants of the heroes of the Golden Age. Now, after decades of waging a hidden war, they have the opportunity to bring long-lasting peace to the planet, but it will require them usurp the plans of a master villain.

As writer Fabian Nicieza said, "let's say you've been fighting the good fight for 50 years. What would you do if a ready-made solution to creating peace on Earth presented itself to you, and all it required was compromising your ethics, just a little?" With the mysterious Citizen V serving as the point man on an international adventure, these conflicted heroes bring high-octane intrigue and a new style of characters to the Marvel Universe.
