"Lies!" <br>
Heartbroken after her break up with Peter (Colossus), Kitty decides to go home to her parents to recoup. While there, she over hears a peculiar exchange between her father and some business associates from overseas. Fearing for her father's life, Kitty follows him to Japan to help in any way she can. But in the Land of the Rising Sun, Kitty is alone, cold, hungry, and soon finds herself in way over her head. But this is nothing compared to the startlingly revelation that her very own father may be falling in with the Yakuza.
