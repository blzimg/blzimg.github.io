An emotional look at the root causes of terrorism from MacArthur Prizewinning author Jay Cantor. What causes terrorism?
</p><p>
After his fiancee dies during the 9/11 attacks, the question plagues Aaron Goodman. It makes him give up his career as a doctor to become an interrogator/torturer at Guantanamo Bay. And yet, he's still no less obsessed. He begins overseeing experiments of how meme theory might program people into becoming suicide bombers. Could there be a science behind terrorism? Still nothing – until he meets Ahmed, a Gitmo prisoner who might know how the jihadists are using a variation of meme theory in their camps.
</p><p>
To finally learn the truth, Aaron and Ahmed’s search will take them from Gitmo to the jihadist camps in Pakistan right back to Ground Zero in New York City. But where do Ahmed’s real loyalties lie, and will Aaron’s exploration into terrorist camps make him as much of a threat as those he’s protecting his country against?
