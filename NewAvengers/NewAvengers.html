After the Devasting destruction of the orginal Avengers just what sort of threat to the world could persuade Captain America to assemble an all-new team? And after the events of AVENGERS DISASSEMBLED, who could possibly be on this team? How does Cap, Iron Man, Spider-Man and Wolverine sound? Get ready for the first of a proposed 500-issue run that signals an all-new era, the launch of the all-new ongoing Avengers series!
