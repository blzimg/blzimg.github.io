Asa Elmer "Ace" Reid, Jr., (1925-1991) was the creator of the cartoon Cowpokes and a Western humorist. Cowpokes, at one time, ran in over 400 weekly newspapers across the United States. He produced many popular cartoon books and calendars during his lifetime. Shortly after his birth, the family moved to Electra, Texas, where he grew up ranching and cowboying.During World War II, he served as a machinist's mate in the U.S. Navy in the Pacific aboard the USS Lanier . Cowpokes was born on board the Lanier; "The Sorry Salt" was a cartoon he drew for the ship's newspaper. After the war, "The Sorry Salt" became "Jake", his primary character.

In 1952 Aceâ€™s first cartoon appeared in West Texas Livestock Weekly. Reid appeared in the early gatherings of the American Cowboy Culture Association, which holds the annual National Cowboy Symposium and Celebration each September in Lubbock, Texas. Ace and Madge were living in Kerrville at the time of his death in 1991. Madge still lives in Kerrville and has kept Cowpokes going since Ace's death.
