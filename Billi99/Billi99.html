The year is 1999. After 20 years of government by advertising, America is in the throes of a second great depression. 19-year-old Billi Chadam chooses to take on a corrupt world with nothing more than an oversized caballero costume and a Toleado sword. Determined to crush her youthful resistance are no less than the Pentagon, the Mafia, the union and Eric Veyhunder - a corporate mogul who makes Genghis Kahn look like a kitten!
