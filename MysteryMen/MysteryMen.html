The first issue is famous for the debut of the Blue Beetle, created by Charles Nicholas Wojtkoski, using the pseudonym Charles Nicholas.
</p><p>
The Blue Beetle's alter-ego is a rookie police officer named Dan Garret. Garret wears a bulletproof costume and after taking '2-X vitamin', he has superhuman strength to help him in his fight against crime. At the height of his popularity the Blue Beetle not only had his own title, but also a comic strip and a radio serial.
</p><p>
The Moth made his debut in Mystery Men Conics #9 (April, 1940). He was created by an unknown writer, which seems to have been the case with many of his contemporary comic book characters, and artist Jim Mooney (Ms. Marvel, Dial H for Hero). Together, they used the house name "Norton Kingsley" as a by-line. Mooney's work continued throughout The Moth's brief run, but the credit was given to "Norman" Kingsley at least once.
</p><p>
The story contained no explanation of who The Moth was, why he did what he did, or where he got his evident ability to fly (tho he didn't display any other super powers). It's been suggested he was a non-powered hero who could fly because of the way his suit was built, but that isn't mentioned in the actual stories. 
</p><p>
Also making his first appearance was 'Rex Dexter of Mars' created the legendary Dick Briefer. The story starts in 1939 at the World's Fair, where Montague Dexter along with his wife is demonstrating his Mars Rocket. Unfortunately, after lift off it completely disappears. In the year 2000, their son returns in the same craft. It emerges that his parents had crash-landed on Mars where Rex was brought up. It had taken many years to repair the ship, and now his parents were too old to make the return trip.
</p><p>
Apart from other debuts, like the Green Mask, Mystery Men also saw the first comic book work by George Tuska with his feature 'Zanzibar'.
