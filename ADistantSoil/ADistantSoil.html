A Distant Soil is an epic space opera comic book series published by American company Image Comics, combining science fiction and fantasy with Arthurian themes. It is written and illustrated by Colleen Doran.
</p><p>
"A forerunner of queer-friendly comics and space opera, A Distant Soil was something that really had not been seen before – a New Age take on science fiction with gorgeous costumes, young siblings with an unknown destiny, a blinding mix of magic with technology…fantasy and alien ships combine under Doran’s ethereal watch."
</p><p>
The story, which Doran created at the age of twelve, centers on a young girl who is born heir to an alien religious dynasty, and explores issues of politics, gender identity, and tolerance. A Distant Soil is among the first US graphic novels created solely by a female writer/artist, appearing in fanzines when the artist was still in high school. A Distant Soil is also notable for being among the earliest comics to feature openly gay characters, predating Marvel's Northstar, and for featuring a gay couple as romantic leads. The series gained a Gaylactic Spectrum Award nomination for Best Other Work in 2001.
</p><p>
It was recommended as a graphic novel of interest to improve reading skills for "reluctant readers" in Library Media Connection. The Voice of Youth Advocates profiled the book in their quarterly journal, stating that one of Doran's influences for A Distant Soil was the 1978 Samuel R. Delany/Howard Chaykin graphic novel Empire.
</p><p>
It is one of the earliest American comics to display the influence of manga (Japanese storytelling techniques,) though Doran does not consider A Distant Soil to be OEL (original English language manga).
</p><p>
The series was a top ten nominee in the 2004 Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Awards, with Doran nominated as Favorite Penciler, Favorite Inker, Favorite Cover Artist, and A Distant Soil nominated for Favorite Comic Book.
</p><p>
Comics Book Resources wrote "...It’s amazing how Doran’s work now seems right in tune with stuff like Hunger Games and the Divergent series, and yet when she was starting this series, there WEREN’T stories out there starring female characters. There weren’t epic space operas about teenage girls. She practically created the genre."
