Like Marvel Premiere, Marvel Chillers features new characters to see if there is enough interest to start a new series, what is sometimes called an umbrella title. For some reason this set did not last long, probably poor sales. The first two issues feature Mordred, the last 5 feature Tigra, who later became a member of the Avengers and a leading member of the west coast Avengers.

Issue #1: Janet Lyton and Grant Whittacker dig a tunnel to try and find the lost tower of Darkhold in England. They work through a storm, which washes out the supports of their tunnel, causing it to cave. In the adjoining chamber they find what they believe is a perfectly preserved human body in a tomb dating back to the Dark Ages. The man comes to life, revealing himself to be Mordred, a magician's apprentice during the final years of Camelot.
