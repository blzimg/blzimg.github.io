Robert Dennis Crumb (born August 30, 1943) is an American cartoonist and musician who often signs his work R. Crumb. His work displays a nostalgia for American folk culture of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, and satire of contemporary American culture.
</p><p>
Crumb is a prolific artist and contributed to many of the seminal works of the underground comix movement in the 1960s, including being a founder of the first successful underground comix publication, <a href="../Zap/Zap.html">Zap Comix</a>, contributing to all 16 issues. He was additionally contributing to the East Village Other and many other publications, including a variety of one-off and anthology comics. 
</p><p>
During this time, inspired by psychedelics and cartoons from the 1920s and 1930s, he introduced a wide variety of characters that became extremely popular, including counter cultural icons Fritz the Cat and Mr. Natural, and the images from his Keep on Truckin' strip. 
</p><p>
Sexual themes abounded in all these projects, often shading into scatological and pornographic comics. In the mid-1970s, he contributed to the Arcade anthology; following the decline of the underground, he moved towards biographical and autobiographical subjects while refining his drawing style, a heavily crosshatched pen-and-ink style inspired by late 19th- and early 20th-century cartooning. 
</p><p>
Much of his work appeared in a magazine he founded, Weirdo (1981â€“1993), which was one of the most prominent publications of the alternative comics era. As his career progressed, his comic work became more autobiographical.
</p><p>
In 1991, Crumb was inducted into the comic book industry's Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame.
