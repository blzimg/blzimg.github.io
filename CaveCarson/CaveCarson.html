Calvin "Cave" Carson is a fictional character that appeared in stories published by DC Comics. Carson, a spelunker, first appeared in Brave and the Bold #31 (September 1960); he was created by France Herron and Bruno Premiani.

The Challengers of the Unknown were a quartet of science fiction adventurers created by Jack Kirby. They debuted in 1957, and their commercial success spawned two other science fiction characters: Cave Carson and Rip Hunter. Hunter was the more successful of the two. Unlike similar groups, namely Rip Hunter's Time Masters and the Sea Devils, Carson and his team never got their own title.

The character was relaunched and reinvented in 2016 for DC's new publishing line Young Animal. The series, Cave Carson Has A Cybernetic Eye, is co-written by Gerard Way and Jon Rivera, with art by Michael Avon Oeming. As of March 2018, the series title was changed to Cave Carson Has An Interstellar Eye. It also began again from issue one.
</p><p>
Cave Carson has done it all: survived countless adventures below the Earth's surface, met the love of his life, and gotten a cybernetic eye...somehow. Now, newly widowed, Cave tries to piece his life back together when a knock on the door of his secret underground lab pulls him back into a past that he and Eileen thought they had left buried deep within the Earth. Cave must determine if his recent hallucinations are the work of his mind or his mysterious cybernetic eye. (Spoiler: It's the eye.)
