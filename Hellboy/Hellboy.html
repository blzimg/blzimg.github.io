Hellboy is a fictional superhero created by writer-artist <a href="../MikeMignola/MikeMignola.html">Mike Mignola</a>. The character first appeared in Dime Press #4 (March 1993) cover only, the San Diego Comic Con Comics #2 (August 1993) contained first full Hellboy appearance, black and white only, then
Next Men #21 (December 1993) had the first appearance in a regularly published title, and has since appeared in various eponymous miniseries, one-shots and inter company crossovers.
The first Hellboy title series in 1994 entitled Hellboy Seed of Destuction, a 4 issue mini series by Dark Horse.
</p><p>
The character has been adapted into two live-action feature films in 2004 and 2008 that starred Ron Perlman in the title role, and two straight-to-DVD animated films, as well as three video games â€“ Asylum Seeker, The Science of Evil, and recently as a playable character in Injustice 2.

A well-meaning half-demon whose true name is Anung Un Rama ("and upon his brow is set a crown of flame"), Hellboy was summoned from Hell to Earth as a baby on October 5th (given as his birth date by Mike Mignola) by Nazi occultists (spawning his hatred for Nazis). He was discovered by the Allied Forces; amongst them, Professor Trevor Bruttenholm, who formed the United States Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense (B.P.R.D.). 
</p><p>
In time, Hellboy grew to be a large, red-skinned adult with a tail, horns (which he files off, leaving behind circular stumps on his forehead), cloven hooves for feet, and an oversized right hand made of stone (the "Right Hand of Doom"). He has been described as smelling of dry-roasted peanuts. Although a bit gruff, he shows none of the malevolence thought to be intrinsic to classical demons, and has an ironic sense of humor. This is said to be because of his upbringing under Professor Bruttenholm, who raised him as a normal boy.
</p><p>
Hellboy works for the B.P.R.D., an international non-governmental agency, and for himself against dark forces including Nazis and witches, in a series of tales that have their roots in folklore, pulp magazines, vintage adventure, Lovecraftian horror and horror fiction. In earlier stories, he is identified as the "World's Greatest Paranormal Investigator".
