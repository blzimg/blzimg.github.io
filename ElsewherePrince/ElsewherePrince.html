In The Elsewhere Prince, a young artist joins a traveling band of mercenaries. After stopping for an evening in a small village, the group adds another member to the group, a young boy who wants to be a warrior. The men are all killed, in a horrible battle with a beetle-like creature called a Jouk. The rest of the series chronicles the adventures of the surviving two members of the traveling party, the artist, and upstart warrior. R.J.M.
