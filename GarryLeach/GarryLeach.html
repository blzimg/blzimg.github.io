Garry Leach (1954) is a British comics artist and publisher. Garry Leach's early work for <a href="../2000AD/2000AD.html">2000 AD</a> included mainly one-off stories featuring Dan Dare and <a href="../FleetwayQuality/FleetwayQuality.html">M.A.C.H. 1</a>. He later worked on the series <a href="../FleetwayQuality/FleetwayQuality.html">The V.C.s</a>. Leach has illustrated cards for the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering.

In 1981 he joined Dez Skinn's company, <a href="../FleetwayQuality/FleetwayQuality.html">Quality Communications</a> (later Fleetway Quality), where he worked as art director and was the first artist with <a href="../AlanMoore/AlanMoore.html">Alan Moore</a> on the revival of <a href="../Miracleman/Miracleman.html">Marvelman</a> in Warrior. His work on Marvelman proved highly popular but due to his slow pace of working, he left art duties to be replaced by Alan Davis. For Davis' first few stories Leach worked as inker to allow Davis to settle into the strip. Leach's work on Marvelman remained the prototype, as Davis has insisted that "my ‘style’ on the series was simply a bargain-basement attempt to imitate what Garry had done".

Leach and Alan Moore also created Warpsmith for Warrior together; Warpsmith featured in its own strip and eventually became a supporting character in Marvelman. With Dave Elliott, Leach set up <a href="../AtomekaPress/AtomekaPress.html">Atomeka Press</a> in 1988. Their first title was the anthology title, <a href="../A1/A1.html">A1</a>, which included new Warpsmith material by Moore and Leach.
