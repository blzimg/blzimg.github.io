One of the Big Five boys' story papers from D.C. Thomson. Featuring illustrated stories (comics) of adventure, sports, schooldays, crime, Science Fiction and jokes. This paper ran from Sep 1922 for 1970 issues. The run ended in Nov. 1963. They bear no relation to the American pulps or, in fact, the British pocket libraries. They are in a class of their own being anthology story papers which appeared, for the most part, weekly and were aimed at kids and teenagers but were consumed also by many adults. The mix of illustrated serials of many genres, a few pages every week, ensured there was something for every reader in every issue and they sold well.
