When a journal purported to be written by Edgar Allan Poe falls into the hands of Poe scholar Sterling Tuttle, the voice of the long-dead author reaches out from beyond the grave to give a chilling account of his tortured life. Haunted by the ghosts of his tragic past and the burden of relentless alcoholism, Poe soon finds that his creativity may depend on actual demons who have an unsavory agenda of their own.
