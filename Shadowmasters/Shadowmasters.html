The Shadowmasters are a group of fictional ninja characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The characters have been depicted as the Punisher's allies. They were created by Carl Potts in 1989. They first appeared in The Punisher War Journal, leading to their own 4-issue limited mini series starting with Shadowmasters #1 in October 1989.

The Shadowmasters are an ancient clan of martial arts masters of ninjutsu native to the Iga Province of Japan. For centuries they have served as protectors of Iga and its people, posing as half-demon and half-human beings. When Japan surrendered after World War II, Shigeru Ezaki was one of the last Shadowmasters and the mayor of a small town in Iga named Ueno, whose his wife has been just killed in the U.S. atomic bombing in the closing days of the war.

But when the U.S. Army Captain James Richards, who oversaw the occupation of Iga Province, saved the life of Ezaki's son, the two became friends and together fought against a fanatical die-hard band of Japanese military stragglers holed up in the mountains of Iga. 
</p><p>
The decimated enemy group appeared to be forced to disband, but really they just changed their tactics: led by a man named Umezu, they founded a supposed business corporation called the Sunrise Society, serving as a cover for a Japanese ultranationalist crime syndicate with the aim of seizing control of Japan and bringing the country back to its Imperial glory.
