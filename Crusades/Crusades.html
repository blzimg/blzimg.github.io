After her run-in with the rampaging Knight in last month's The Crusades: Urban Decree, Venus begins to doubt her own senses and seeks out professional help. Meanwhile, as the violence in the streets continues, the manic radio talk-show host Anton Marx fans the reactionary flames of San Francisco public opinion.
</p><p>
Speculation about the identity and intentions of a Dark Ages Knight lopping off limbs in the streets of present-day San Francisco escalates. As fact-checker Venus Kostopikas turns her methods of inquisition in toward her own hazy recollections of The Knight, her sometimes boyfriend, and all-times obnoxious radio personality Anton Marx makes a startling revelation about his own personal knowledge of the mounted man of mayhem carving up his city's inhabitants. And what part does the Pope play in the blood-bath?
