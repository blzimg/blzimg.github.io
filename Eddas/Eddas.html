Rooted in an oral tradition, fantastic sagas of Norse mythology found their way into print seven centuries ago, in two documents the prose Edda and the Poetic Edda, collectively known as the Eddas. 
</p><p>
From these works come the traditional Norse characters like Odin, Thor, Loki as well as works derived from the Eddas such as J.R.R. Tolkien's "The Hobbit" (1937) and "Lord of the Rings" (1954), as well as Richard Wagner's famous Opera Der Ring des Nibelungen (The Ring of the Nibelung) in 1876.
</p><p>
The Prose Edda, sometimes referred to as the Younger Edda or Snorri's Edda, is an Icelandic manual of poetics which also contains many mythological stories. It was written by the Icelandic scholar and historian Snorri Sturluson around 1220. It survives in four known manuscripts and three fragments, written down from about 1300 to about 1600.
</p><p>
The Prose Edda consists of a Prologue and three separate books: Gylfaginning, concerning the creation and foretold destruction and rebirth of the Norse mythical world; Skáldskaparmál, a dialogue between Aegir, a Norse god connected with the sea, and Bragi, the skaldic god of poetry, and Háttatal.
</p><p>
The Poetic Edda, also known as the Elder Edda, is a collection of Old Norse poems from the Icelandic medieval manuscript Codex Regius ("Royal Book"). Along with the Prose Edda, the Poetic Edda is the most expansive source on Norse mythology. The first part of the Codex Regius preserves poems that narrate the creation and foretold destruction and rebirth of the Old Norse mythological world as well as individual myths about gods concerning Norse deities. The poems in the second part narrate legends about Norse heroes and heroines, such as Sigurd, Brynhildr and Gunnar.
</p><p>
The Codex Regius was written in the 13th century, but nothing is known of its whereabouts until 1643, when it came into the possession of Brynjólfur Sveinsson, then the Church of Iceland's Bishop of Skálholt. At that time, versions of the Prose Edda were well known in Iceland, but scholars speculated that there once was another Edda—an Elder Edda—which contained the pagan poems Snorri quotes in his book. When the Codex Regius was discovered, it seemed that this speculation had proven correct.
