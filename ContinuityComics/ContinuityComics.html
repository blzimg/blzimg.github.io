Continuity Publishing, also known as Continuity Comics, was an American independent comic book company formed by Neal Adams in 1984, publishing comics until 1994. After years as a freelancer and comics art packager (with his company Continuity Associates), in 1984 Adams ventured into publishing as a way to maximize his creative freedom (and profits). Continuity mainly published a variety of superhero comics developed by Adams. (For instance, the title Ms. Mystic was first published by Pacific Comics, and was revived in 1987 by Continuity.)

Adams' own detailed, realistic art was the basis of Continuity's "house style"; the company's creators included Dan Barry, Vicente Alcazar, Mike Deodato, Jr., Mark Texeira, Dave Hoover, Richard Bennett, Tom Grindberg, Bart Sears, Esteban Maroto, and Michael Netzer. Adams often provided layouts for the company's titles, as well as inking many faces and contributing other personal touch-up artwork. Adams also plotted many of Continuity's titles, most of which were scripted by writer Peter Stone.
