Ben Grimm heads back to Yancy Street. Witness the Fantastic Four's strongest member's origins from a youthful member in the Yancy Street Gang, to his All-America football days, to his first meeting with Reed Richards (Mister Fantastic), and the fateful trip on a rocket ship that forever changed his life.
