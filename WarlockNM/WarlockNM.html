Warlock is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was introduced as part of a subplot in New Mutants #18 and was created by Chris Claremont and Bill Sienkiewicz. He joined the titular superteam in issue #21, and remained a part of the cast until he was killed off in issue #95. A young alien with a body that can assume any shape, he was commonly used for visual gags and fish-out-of-water humor.

Warlock is a member of the alien Technarchy, a race of mechanical organisms that survive by infecting living creatures with the "techno-organic" transmode virus, before draining the life energy ("lifeglow") of the infected organism. Unlike others of his race, Warlock possesses a distinctive degree of compassion, and as a result was dubbed a mutant in spirit. It was later discovered that he is in fact a mutant of his race even though he has yet to display any abilities beyond those natural to the Technarch.

He is the son of the Technarch ruler who has battled the New Mutants and the X-Men. Warlock served as a member of the original New Mutants for much of that group's existence, and became the best friend of his teammate Cypher (Doug Ramsey).

Because of Warlock's compassion, he refuses to drain other sentient creatures of their "lifeglow". Because of the difficulty in determining whether or not a creature is sentient, New Mutants leader Danielle Moonstar ordered him not to drain any large creatures without permission, however, Warlock often drains such creatures at his discretion when Danielle is not present (so he is probably a guy).
