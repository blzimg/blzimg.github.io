First series, issue #1: Written by Cullen Bunn. Art by Salva Espin. Cover by Declan Shalvey. Deadpool might be an Avenger now, but he's also got his own private team of mercenaries...the legally-cleared-to-be-called MERCS FOR MONEY! Got a problem you can't solve on your own and a pile of money you'd like to be rid of? Just call Deadpool, Stingray, Massacre, Solo, Foolkiller, Terror and Slapstick and watch as that problem is shot, stabbed, eviscerated, pulverized and generally made bloody!

Second series seems to have started because issue #1 sells well. I honestly don't know why else they make multiple covers and restart series all the time other than to milk collectors and create fake media buzz. I shouldn't judge though, I have no idea how it works, how much money they make, or how much pressure they are under.
