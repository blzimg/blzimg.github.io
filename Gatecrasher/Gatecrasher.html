Six issues in 2000 by <a href="../BlackBull/BlackBull.html">Black Bull</a>. Cover of issue 7 really caught my eye, which turned out to be a painting by the Hildebrandt Brothers, no wonder. The other painted covers are by Glenn Fabry. The illustrated covers and most of the story pencils are by Amanda Conner.

Unbeknownst to the human race, a great and terrible evil threatens to engulf the earth." college freshman Alec Wagner as the "Gatecrasher," a somewhat reluctant member of a covert brigade of warriors dedicated to protecting Earth. As sole possessor of the ability to predict the opening of inter-dimensional gates, Alec assumes nearly overwhelming responsibility for his team, conducting the Split-Second Squad against alien invaders. However, battling aliens is not the only thing on Alec's mind. While juggling college and inter-dimensional combat, Alec also has high prospects for his social life, if he could ever show up on time for a date! 
</p><p>
Over a year has passed since the conclusion of the Gatecrasher Ring of Fire, our hero Alec Wagner is harder, stronger and... more mature? What terrible tragedy has brought him to this new drastic change? Alec has lost many of his friends... Hazard is gone and the Split-Second Squad has been gutted. Meet Alec's weird college roommate, a bevy of hot girls and a battalion of dark enemies. The word is out across the galaxy, the first sentient race to catch Alec will capture the keys to galactic conquest!
