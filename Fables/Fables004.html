Part 4 of 5 "Legends in Exile."<br>
Bigby Wolf's investigation into Rose's murder reaches its climax at the Remembrance Day Ball, an annual event that commemorates and revisits the secret history of Fabletown. But who would invite a psycho-killer to the most prestigious social event of the year? Plus, Bigby dusts off his twenty-year-old tuxedo, grabs a partner and hits the dance floor with disastrous results.
