"Animal Farm." Part 5 of 5<br>
The revolt at the Farm has been suppressed, the revolutionaries quelled. Goldilocks remains on the loose since her seemingly fatal shooting but the rest of the dissidents have been tried and sentenced. The executioner's axe is sharp and swift as the Fables learn what true justice means.
