"Legends in Exile Chapter 2: The Unusual Suspects" <br>
Bigby Wolf, Fabletown's one-man police force, interrogates some shady suspects for Rose Red's probable murder, including Bluebeard, a known ladykiller...literally. Snow White reveals the salacious act that destroyed not only her marriage but her relationship with her sister, and penniless philanderer Prince Charming decides to sell his royal title over the internet.
