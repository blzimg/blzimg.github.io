Part 3 of 5 "Legends in Exile."<br>
The mystery of Rose Red's murder unfolds at a feverish pace. Bigby Wolf grills the Black Forest Witch, who may have returned to her old eating habits. Snow White consults her boss, Fabletown's Mayor King Cole, who reveals his secret knowledge of Rose's love life. Boy Blue and Flycatcher spill far too much blood. And jailed suspect Jack receives two surprise visitors behind bars: an angry, knife-wielding stranger and Bigby, who's forced to reveal his true colors.
