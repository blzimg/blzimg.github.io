"Animal Farm" Part 1 of 5<br>
The mystery of her sister's murder has been solved, and the guilty parties have been punished. This leaves Fabletown's Deputy Mayor Snow White physically exhausted, spiritually drained, and in need of a big rest. So she decides to personally drive one errant Colin Piggy back up to the Farm, the remote, upstate annex where the non-human Fables reside. But rest and relaxation will have to wait for our heroine. Something wicked is brewing in upstate New York and Snow White's untimely arrival lands her in the thick of it.
