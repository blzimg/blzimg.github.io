"Animal Farm," Part 3 of 5<br>
The Fables at the Farm are now in open revolt, and the always practical, always proper Snow White finds herself at the top of the radicals' hit list. Her adversaries number in the hundreds, while her only ally seems to be the crass and wily Reynard the Fox. Together, to get to the truth, the two fugitives have to make their way to the caves beyond the Valley of the Sleepers. But first they have to survive crossing the tall grass, which inhabits sleeping giants and belongs to the ravenous Shere Khan.
