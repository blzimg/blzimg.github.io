Led by Snow White, a reformed Bigby Wolf, and a slew of others, the secret community of Fabletown is adjusting to life among the "mundanes." But this is no fairy tale, and when Snow White's estranged sister, Rose Red, goes missing ? her apartment a grizzly, bloody scene ? it's up to her sister and Mr. Wolf to find the culprit. But the question remains, will they find Rose intact, or will the cryptic message on her wall come true: "No More Happily Ever After?"
