<img src="OpenSourceLab.jpg"> <br>
Creator: Joshua M. Pearce<br>
Publisher: 2014 Elsevier<br>
<p>
The academic book is a guide, which details the development of free and open-source hardware primarily for scientists and university faculty. It provides step-by-step instructions on building laboratory hardware and scientific instruments. 
</p><p>
It also provides instructions on digital design sharing, Arduino microcontrollers, RepRap 3D Printers for scientific use and how to use open-source hardware licenses. The Guardian discusses how ideas in the Open-Source Lab could enable 3D printing to offer developing-world scientists savings on replica lab kits.
</p><p>
The Open-Source Lab book has been covered extensively by the media. It was one of the top books chosen by Shareable for "New Books About Sharing, Cities and Happiness".

The book itself is not open source and is sold under copyright by Elsevier.
