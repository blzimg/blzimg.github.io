Mark Kalesniko reprises his alter ego, Alex Kalienka, for his most ambitious and accomplished graphic novel yet. Trapped in a horrific traffic jam en route to his job at an animation studio, Alex reminisces about his myriad artistic and romantic frustrations since moving to Los Angeles, fantasizes about what his life would have been like in the postwar golden age of the animation industry, and imagines himself the victim of gruesome traffic accidents. Kalesniko skillfully juggles the three tiers of the narrative, using fade-ins to mark the transitions between eras.

Alex depicted, as always, as a dog-headed man to mark his alienation and in tribute to cartooning's anthropomorphic animals, has always been a touchingly sympathetic figure, but Freeway's massive length allows Kalesniko to give the character a heretofore unseen depth. Although Kalesniko's formal storytelling devices, particularly his deft panel arrangements and intelligent compositions, are largely responsible for Freeway's impressive effectiveness, it's his distinctive and delicate drawing style that supplies the emotional component, best displayed in the economical character design and in the painstakingly researched, lovingly depicted scenes of a bygone Los Angeles.
