Spectre is the name given to several fictional anti-hero characters who have appeared in numerous comic books published by DC Comics. The character first appeared in More Fun Comics #52 (Feb. 1940). He was created by Jerry Siegel and Bernard Baily, although several sources attribute creator credit solely to Siegel, limiting Baily to being merely the artist assigned to the feature.

The Spectre debuted in More Fun Comics #52 (February 1940) when hard-boiled cop Jim Corrigan, on his way with his fianc√©e Clarice to their engagement party, is murdered by thugs who stuff him into a barrel filled with cement and then throw it into a body of water. His spirit is refused entry into the afterlife however, and he is sent back to Earth by an entity referred to only as "The Voice" to eliminate evil.
