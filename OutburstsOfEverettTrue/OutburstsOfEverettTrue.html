The Outbursts of Everett True (originally titled A Chapter from the Career of Everett True) was a two-panel newspaper comic strip created by A.D. Condo and J. W. Raper that ran from July 22, 1905 to January 13, 1927, when Condo had to abandon it due to health reasons.

Two contemporary collections appeared in 1907 and 1921, and it was the Newspaper Enterprise Association's "most popular feature". Subsequently, aside from occasional appearances in Alley Oop in 1969 the strip was largely forgotten until 1983 when one of the collections was reprinted that year, and comic book writer Tony Isabella and various artists employed the character in a new strip for the Comics Buyer's Guide and The Comics Journal. In this modernization, Everett True directed his outbursts at comic book artists, writers, publishers and distributors. In 2015, a new collection was published under the title Outbursts of Everett True with an introduction by Trevor Blake.

The American Bioscope Company made a series of silent short movies featuring Everett True, the first of which, Everett True Breaks Into The Movies, was released in 1916, starring Robert Bolder as Everett and Paula Reinbold as Mrs True.
