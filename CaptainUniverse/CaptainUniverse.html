He's the hero who could be YOU...but in these stories, being a burglar, a college professor and an astronaut will have to do! Whether it's half-sized as a child or doubled as twins, the Uni-Power transforms its lucky recipient into Captain Universe - countering crises that range from a masked marauder to the edge of apocalypse!
</p><p>
Daredevil:<br>
Pencils by Paul Siqueira<br>
One man knows more about the Uni-Power than anyone on Earth-but he's currently facing jail time! Matt Murdock's going to have a hard time mounting a defence when he has to contend with one of Marvel's nastiest secret organizations. And then there's the small matter of the amplified senses the Uni-Power has given him, including sight!
</p><p>
Incredible Hulk:<br>
Penciled by Carlos Magno.<br> 
Launching out of the pages of AMAZING FANTASY, the CAPTAIN UNIVERSE event kicks into high gear right here! During times of great crisis, the Uni-Power has been known to grant people the spectacular powers of Captain Universe. But now, the Uni-Power is malfunctioning, and it needs the help of Bruce Banner to survive. But can the faltering Uni-Power contain the rage of the Hulk?
</p><p>
Invisible Woman:<br>
Penciled by James Raiz.<br>
The most powerful member of the Fantastic Four takes the spotlight when the ailing Uni-Power bonds with her to copy her powers-she's going to need the added might of the Uni-Power when the Shiar decide it's too dangerous to keep on Earth. Co-Starring the Gladiator.
</p><p>
Silver Surfer:<br>
Penciled by Carlos Magno.<br>
It's the conclusion to the first phase of the CAPTAIN UNIVERSE event! The Silver Surfer is busy trying to help a peaceful alien civilization fend off the advances of a vicious warlord, and when the Uni-Power accidentally bonds with the warlord instead of the Surfer, the Surfer's job gets that much harder!
</p><p>
X-23:<br>
Written by Christopher Yost, Craig Kyle, Penciled by Francis Portella.<br>
Theorizing that a healing factor might give it the strength to repair itself, the Uni-Power attempts to bond with X-23. But the Uni-Power didn't realize just how powerful X-23's healing factor is-powerful enough to resist its attempts to bond. Can the Uni-Power convince Marvel's 'wild child' to let her guard down?
