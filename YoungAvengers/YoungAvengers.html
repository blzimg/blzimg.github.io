The Young Avengers is a fictional superhero team, appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics, and are about as appealing as Hitler Youth. The team, created by Allan Heinberg and Jim Cheung, features numerous adolescent characters who typically have connections to established members of Marvel's primary superhero team, the Avengers. The Young Avengers originally featured in a twelve issue run, later appearing in several notable Marvel crossover series, including the Civil War and The Children's Crusade events, before the series was relaunched in January 2013 as part of the Marvel NOW! rebranding by writer Kieron Gillen and artist Jamie McKelvie.

In "Sidekicks" (issues #1â€“6), reporters Jessica Jones (a former teen superhero known as Jewel) and Kat Farrell of The Daily Bugle and heroes Captain America and Iron Man investigate a new group of teenage heroes. The story is set in the time between the "Avengers Disassembled" storyline and the beginning of New Avengers. Although the team defeats Kang the Conqueror, Captain America and Iron Man take away their gear and refuse to train the team without their parents' consent. Despite the heroes' warnings, the team continues with a new headquarters, new costumes, and new names.
