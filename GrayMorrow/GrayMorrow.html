Dwight Graydon "Gray" Morrow (1934â€“2001) was an American illustrator of comics and paperback books. He is co-creator of the Marvel Comics muck-monster the <a href="../ManThing/ManThing.html">Man-Thing</a> and of DC / Vertigo Old West vigilante <a href="../Vertigo/Vertigo.html">El Diablo</a>.
</p><p>
In the early 1960s, Morrow anonymously illustrated three literary adaptations for <a href="../ClassicsIllustrated/ClassicsIllustrated.html">Classics Illustrated</a>: The Octopus by Frank Norris (#159, Nov. 1960); Master of the World by Jules Verne (#163, July 1961); and The Queen's Necklace by Alexandre Dumas (#165, Jan. 1962). Morrow also supplied drawings for chapters in Classics Illustrated Special Issue #159A, Rockets, Jets and Missiles (Dec. 1960), and in 13 World Around Us issues ranging from Prehistoric Animals (Nov. 1959) to Famous Teens (May 1961).

Morrow next began a three-year association with <a href="../Warren/Warren.html">Warren Publishing's</a> line of black-and-white horror-comics magazines in 1964, starting with the six-page story "Bewitched!," written by Larry Ivie, in <a href="../Creepy/Creepy.html">Creepy</a> #1, and contributed over a dozen stories to that magazine and its sister publication <a href="../Eerie/Eerie.html">Eerie</a>, as well as to the war-comics magazine <a href="../BlazingCombat/BlazingCombat.html">Blazing Combat</a>, through 1967. He also painted four horror covers for Warren. For competitor <a href="../Skywald/Skywald.html">Skywald Publications</a>, he drew the eight-page "The Skin And Bones Syndrome" for <a href="../Psycho/Psycho.html">Psycho</a> #1 (Jan. 1971), and co-created the muck-monster Man-Thing, with writers Roy Thomas and Gerry Conway, in Marvel Comics' first entry into the adult-oriented comics-magazine market, the black-and-white <a href="../SavageTales/SavageTales.html">Savage Tales</a> #1 (May
1971).
</p><p>
By 1970, Morrow was married to Betty Morrow, who wrote a story he drew, "The Journey", in the early independent comic <a href="../Witzend/Witzend.html">Witzend</a> #7 (1970). That same year he returned to color comics, drawing several supernatural-fantasy stories for DC Comics' <a href="../WitchingHour/WitchingHour.html">Witching Hour</a>, <a href="../HouseOfSecrets/HouseOfSecrets.html">House of Secrets</a> and <a href="../HouseOfMystery/HouseOfMystery.html">House of Mystery</a>, as well as a smattering of romance and superhero tales. He also drew Western stories, and with writer Robert Kanigher co-created the Old West vigilante El Diablo in <a href="../DCComics/DCComics.html">All-Star Western</a> #2 (Oct. 1970). He did a small amount of work for Marvel during this time, with the cover and a romance story for <a href="../MyLove/MyLove.html">My Love</a> #14 (Nov. 1971), a Man-Thing cover and story in <a href="../Fear/fear.html">Adventure into Fear</a> #10 (Oct. 1972), two "Gullivar Jones, Warrior of Mars" stories in <a href="../CreaturesOnTheLoose/CreaturesOnTheLoose.html">Creatures on the Loose</a> #20-21 (Nov. 1972 - Jan. 1973), and virtually his only Marvel superhero story, a 10-page Falcon feature in <a href="../CaptainAmerica/CaptainAmerica.html">Captain America</a> #144 (Dec. 1971).
</p><p>
In 1978, he began publishing, in Heavy Metal magazine, a series of stories that would be collected in 2012 as chapters of the sword and sorcery graphic novel <a href="GrayMorrow10.jpg">Orion and the Edge of Chaos</a>.
