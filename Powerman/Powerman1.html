"Out of Hell--a Hero!"<br>
When Lucas, an innocent man, is sent to jail for a crime he did not commit, he decides he has nothing left to loose. Subjecting himself to unorthodox experiments, this inmate is endowed with great physical strength and nigh-unbreakable skin. No walls and bars on Earth can hold him. Now, as Luke Cage, he is known as the Hero for Hire, and he's here to clean up the "Mean Streets," one criminal at a time.
