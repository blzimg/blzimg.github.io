Silver Sable (Silver Sablinova) is a fictional character appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. She is a mercenary, hunter of war criminals, the leader of the Wild Pack, and owner of Silver Sable International. Although sometimes a legitimate mercenary, her methods and motives have sometimes brought her into conflict with other superheroes. Occasionally, she is seen as an ally of Spider-Man and other heroes.
</p><p>
The operations of Wild Pack and Silver Sable International drive the national economy of the fictional small European state of Symkaria. The name Wild Pack had been used by the mercenary squad led by Cable for some time, until a legal notice forced them to change it to Six Pack.
</p><p>
The State of Symkaria is adjacent to Latveria, the nation that is ruled by Doctor Doom. Silver Sable and Victor Von Doom have an annual diplomatic dinner at Castle Doom, situated in Doomstadt. Apparently the friendship between these two states is deep-rooted and dates back to World War II.
</p><p>
Silver Sable is an athletic woman with no superhuman powers. She is a formidable hand-to-hand combatant, and skilled in various martial arts, and she is an expert markswoman, swordswoman, and gymnast. She also possesses strong leadership capabilities.
</p><p>
Silver Sable wears synthetic stretch fabric lined with Kevlar throughout the torso. She often carries a saber or rapier (dueling sword), chai (three-pronged half-moon throwing projectiles), a 9mm pistol and derringer. Silver Sable generally has the latest technology and equipment at her disposal, provided by Silver Sable International.
