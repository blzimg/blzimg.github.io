"Punishment and Crime" The Sinister Syndicate is back in business and their first mission is to rob the Federal Reserve Bank! The Beetle, Boomerang, Hydro-Man, Rhino, and Speed Demon easily knock out the guards and open the vault! However before the quintet of super-villains can escape with the gold, the Spectacular Spider-Man arrives on the scene! The Beetle wisely tells his teammates to ignore the wall-crawler and focus on their getaway! But Boomerang can't resist taking a potshot at the web-slinger! And that foolish action results in Boomerang's capture...and starts the splintering of the syndicate!
