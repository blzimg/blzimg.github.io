About: In the brutal world of the Age of X, we see how the non-mutant heroes were affected, leading up to an "Avengers" team converging on a mutant hideout. Non-mutant superhumans like Spider-Man are also being hunted. In this story, Peter and MJ deal with getting her out of the country to protect their unborn daughter.
