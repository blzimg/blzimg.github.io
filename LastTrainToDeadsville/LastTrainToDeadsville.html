Dark Horse is bloody thrilled to present the most terrifying team-up of talent to hit the comics scene in years, as fan-favorite horror scribe Steve Niles (30 Days of Night, Dark Days, Criminal Macabre) joins artist Kelley Jones (Deadman, Batman, TheHammer) to bring you the follow-up to last year's hit miniseries Criminal Macabre, Last Train to Deadsville takes supernatural private dick Cal McDonald and his ghoulish partner Mo'Lock on their weirdest adventure yet, when a teenage, mulleted weirdo from suburbia takes his occult fantasies a little, okay, A LOT, too far. And Ozzy thought his train was crazy!
