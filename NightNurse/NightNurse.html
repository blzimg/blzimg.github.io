Night Nurse is a Marvel Comics comic book series published in the early 1970s, as well as the alter ego later taken on by one of its characters, Linda Carter. Carter was one of three central characters who first appeared in Night Nurse #1 (cover-dated Nov. 1972), though she was previously the lead of another Marvel series, Linda Carter, Student Nurse, published in 1961. Carter later adopted the name "Night Nurse" for herself, and in this incarnation, first appeared in Daredevil #58 (May 2004), she is as a medical professional specializing in helping injured superheroes.

Matt Murdock / Daredevil refers to her then as "the night nurse ... [who is] sympathetic to ... costumed persons who get a little nicked up in ... the call of duty."

Night Nurse co-star Christine Palmer reappeared in Nightcrawler vol. 3, #1 (Sept. 2004). Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, the writer of Nightcrawler, said he was "a huge fan" of Night Nurse, and wanted to bring back the character when he realized that his first Nightcrawler story would take place in a hospital. A one-shot issue, Night Nurse vol. 2 (July 2015), reprinted the 1970s series' four issues as well as Daredevil vol. 2, #80 (Feb. 2006).
