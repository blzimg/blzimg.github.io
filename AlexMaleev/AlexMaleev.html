Alex Maleev (born 1971) is a Bulgarian comic book illustrator, best known for the Marvel Comics' series Daredevil with frequent collaborator Brian Michael Bendis. He did work on James O'Barr's The Crow (Dead Time and Flesh and Blood) and subsequently storyboarding the "Lost in Space" film at Continuity Associates before entering a successful run at DC Comics on Batman: No Man's Land.

He first teamed with Bendis on Todd McFarlane's Sam and Twitch series in 2000-2001 before they were recruited for Daredevil. In 2006, Maleev finished his run with Bendis in Daredevil and planned a collaboration with the writer on a new ongoing Spider-Woman series. Bendis and Maleev collaborated once again on the much delayed four part Halo: Uprising miniseries from Marvel Comics. Bendis and Maleev relaunched Moon Knight in 2011 with volume 4, and are currently working on the creator owned comic Scarlet, under the Marvel imprint Icon Comics.

Maleev also did art for the "New Avengers: Illuminati" special, the January 2007 issue of the New Avengers, issue #26 and the one-shots, Civil War: The Confession and Secret Invasion: Dark Reign. He also did the art work for the character "Sylar" on the TV show "Heroes." Often blending photographic and digital effects with drawing in his comics art (e.g., Daredevil), Maleev also demonstrates facility with traditional media such as watercolors and gouache (Spider-woman, e.g.).
