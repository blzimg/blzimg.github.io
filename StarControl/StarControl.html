Star Control: Famous Battles of the Ur-Quan Conflict, Volume IV or just simply Star Control is a science fiction video game developed by Toys for Bob and published by Accolade in 1990. It was originally released for Amiga and MS-DOS in 1990, followed by a Mega Drive/Genesis port in 1991. Simple ported versions were also released for the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum.
</p><p>
Star Control II: The Ur-Quan Masters is a science fiction video game, a sequel to Star Control. It was developed by Toys for Bob (Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III) and originally published by Accolade in 1992 for MS-DOS.
</p><p>
Released to critical acclaim, Star Control II is widely viewed today as one of the greatest PC games ever made, and has appeared on numerous publications lists of the greatest video games of all time.
</p><p>
This game features exoplanet abundant star systems, hyperspace travel, extraterrestrial life, and interstellar diplomacy, with the game featuring 25 different alien races that can be communicated with.
</p><p>
The game was ported to the 3DO by Crystal Dynamics in 1994 with an enhanced multimedia presentation, allowed by the CD technology. The source code of the 3DO port was licensed under the GNU GPL in 2002, the game content under a Creative Commons license. The 3DO code was then ported to PC as The Ur-Quan Masters. A sequel, Star Control 3, was released in 1996.
</p><p>
The Ur-Quan Masters (or UQM) project aimed to port Star Control II to modern operating systems including Windows, Linux, Mac OS X, and BSD. The project began in 2002 when the original creators Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III released the source code of the 3DO version as open source under the GPL.
</p><p>
The project was renamed The Ur-Quan Masters because the trademark Star Control was registered by Accolade in 1997, acquired in 1999 by Atari (then known as Infogrames), along with the rest of Accolade's assets. Its latest version, 0.7.0, was released on 4 July 2011. 
</p><p>
The Ur-Quan Masters adds the option of online multiplayer Melee play, something which was not available in the original game. The ability to mod the game was one of the project's goals, and a variety of modifications to the melee have been released by fans, including versions with superpowered ships and numerous planets. A high-definition graphics version of the game, UQM-HD, was subsequently released in beta in 2013.
</p><p>
Star Control: Origins is a strategy video game developed and published by Stardock Entertainment for Microsoft Windows, with a console release planned. It is intended as an addition to the 1990s era Star Control series. The game was announced in 2016, and has been available for PC on Steam since 2017.
</p><p>
With the introduction of Origins, the Star Control setting becomes a multiverse. Origins takes place in an alternate universe, away from the events of the original trilogy. However, it features a similar tone, with vibrant tones and lightheartedness interspersed with darker moments.
</p><p>
The game begins in the year 2086. Many alien species have already learned how to travel through space. The human space agency Star Control launches Earth's first interstellar-capable ship to investigate an alien distress signal. The player assumes the role of the captain of that ship.
</p><p>
In 2013, Atari filed for bankruptcy and began selling its assets, which included the sale of its remaining Star Control assets to Stardock. Stardock claims to have purchased from Atari the Star Control Trademark and publishing rights for the original Star Control trilogy, whereas the series' creators Fred Ford and Paul Reiche III claim to own the Copyright in the first two games.
</p><p>
The dispute led to Stardock filing a lawsuit against Ford and Reiche for trademark infringement, with a counter-suit against Stardock for copyright infringement. As such, Star Control: Origins does not use settings, characters, or plot details from the original Star Control games, and is thus almost completely unrelated to the franchise.
