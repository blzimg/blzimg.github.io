What starts as a childish bid for her father's affections turns into nail-biting suspense when a young girl named Mia falls into a world of crime, lies and gritty realism.
</p><p>
Silverfish begins with a mysterious murder, but the focus of the book is on two sisters, Mia and Stacy, who've managed to have the house to themselves while their father and stepmother are out of town. A few of Mia's friends arrive shortly after the parents have left and the group's boredom and curiosity lead them to a buried secret. 
</p><p>
The story takes place in Seaside Heights, NJ in the winter of 1988. Lapham manages to create a sense of claustrophobia in what is essentially a desolate wasteland. When you're trapped in a house in a deserted boardwalk town, even if you can escape there is nowhere to run. And that's pretty scary.
