The Sub-Mariner created by Bill Everett. "Purpose!" For months the Avenging Son has been MIA. Now he's back with a new mission. Where brute force has failed in the past, the mighty Sub-Mariner will attack the corporate world, those who continue to pollute the oceans, using their own tactics. Beginning a brand new chapter in the saga of Prince Namor!

NOTE: This issue attempts to explain why Namor has such an anger management problem. It has something to do with him being of both surface and Atlantean heritage.
