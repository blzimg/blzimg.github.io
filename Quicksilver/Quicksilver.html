Quicksilver (Pietro Maximoff) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character first appeared in the comic book X-Men #4 (March 1964) and was created by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby. The character has since starred in two self-titled limited series, and has historically been depicted as a regular team member in superhero title The Avengers.

Quicksilver has the superhuman ability to move at great speeds. In most depictions, he is a mutant, a human born with innate superhuman powers. In comic book stories beginning in 2015, he is the product of genetic experimentation by the High Evolutionary. Quicksilver most commonly appears in fiction associated with the X-Men, having been introduced as an adversary for the superhero team. In later stories, he became a superhero himself. He is the twin brother of the Scarlet Witch and, in most depictions, the son of Magneto and the half-brother of Polaris.

Debuting in the Silver Age of comic books, Quicksilver has featured in several decades of Marvel continuity, starring in the self-titled series Quicksilver and as a regular team member in superhero title the Avengers. The character has also appeared in a range of movie, television, and video game adaptations. Two separate live-action versions of the character have been adapted by two different film studios: Aaron Taylor-Johnson portrays the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise, appearing in Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) and Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015), while Evan Peters portrays Quicksilver in the 20th Century Fox films X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014) and X-Men: Apocalypse (2016). He had a cameo in Deadpool 2 (2018) and will return in the upcoming film X-Men: Dark Phoenix.
