Bernard Krigstein (1919 – 1990) was an American illustrator and gallery artist who received acclaim for his innovative and influential approach to comic book art, notably in EC Comics. He was known as Bernie Krigstein, and his artwork usually displayed the signature B. Krigstein. His best-known work in comic books is the short story "Master Race", originally published in the debut issue (April 1955) of EC Comics' <a href="../ImpactEC/Impact01.html">Impact #1</a>.

In 1952, Krigstein spearheaded an effort by himself and fellow comics artists Arthur Peddy, George Evans and Edd Ashe to found the comics industry's short-lived attempt at a labor union, The Society of Comic Book Illustrators. The organization went defunct shortly after publication of its third and final newsletter in June 1953. Krigstein began getting less work from his four mainstays — National Comics (the future DC Comics), Atlas Comics (the future Marvel Comics), MLJ Comics (the future Archie Comics) and Ziff-Davis. But during his presidency of the Society, the politically like-minded publisher of EC Comics, William Gaines, began giving him work. There, Krigstein "would produce the most acclaimed stories of his career between 1953 and 1955."
