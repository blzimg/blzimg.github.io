Enraged by his son's arrogance, Zeus banishes him to the one place that might teach even an immortal humility. Too long has Hercules dwelled among mortals so Zeus sends him out into the void of space. Out here among the countless stars he hopes Hercules will learn the lessons he himself could not teach.
