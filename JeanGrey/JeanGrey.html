When the teenage Marvel Girl traveled through time and arrived in the present, she learned the terrible fate that befell her adult counterpart. Possessed by a cosmic entity called the Phoenix, that Jean Grey was trapped in an endless cycle of life and death. Now, determined to escape that future, young Jean sets out to write her own destiny. But when she has a premonition that the Phoenix is coming for her, she'll have to fight tooth and nail not to become its next victim! Jean enlists the help of some of its previous hosts - but will the ultimate brain trust of Rachel Grey, Quentin Quire and Hope Summers have the answers she's searching for?

Even though Jean Grey’s a founding member of the X-Men who’s been the focal point of many of Marvel’s most defining stories, there’s never really been much of an effort to truly explore who Jean—the person—is, or how she sees herself. Jean Grey takes one of the X-Men’s most convoluted plotlines involving time travel and uses it as an opportunity to give a teenaged Jean a look at the world shaped by her older self and the Phoenix Force. In seeing Teen Jean confront her peers from the future, Jean Grey exposes just how much our ideas about the heroine has been largely based on other people’s perceptions and expectations of her.
</p><p>
As Teen Jean has struggled to get out from underneath her future self’s shadow, new parts of her personality and identity manifest and become fully realized. She’s a drastically more powerful and complex person than the Jean we’ve traditionally known, but she’s also more than aware that she can’t outrun her inevitable destiny to become a Phoenix avatar. Jean Grey’s a story about discovery and self-actualization that, despite all of its cosmic superhero trappings, will resonate with you on a deep level.
