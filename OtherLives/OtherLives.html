Written and illustrated by Peter Bagge<br>
<p>
Meet three certified geeks: a self-loathing journalist who has a seemingly normal girlfriend, a conspiracy theorist who still lives with his mother and an unemployed gamer who lives in his car. 
</p><p>
These strangely likable misfits find that dark personal secrets can sometimes be a virtue in OTHER LIVES, a hilarious original graphic novel by award-winning creator Peter Bagge (Hate). The story also explores people's identities, both real and created, and how the two become confused and conflated through the Internet and role-playing games.
