Publisher: 1996 Nintendo, The Pokemon Company<br>
<p>
Pokemon is a media franchise managed by The Pokemon Company, a Japanese consortium between Nintendo, Game Freak, and Creatures. As of March 2017, the franchise has grossed revenues of $55.15 billion USD worldwide.
</p><p>
The franchise copyright is shared by all three companies, but Nintendo is the sole owner of the trademark.The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995, and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokemon", which humans, known as Pokemon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport.
</p><p>
The franchise began as a pair of video games for the original Game Boy that were developed by Game Freak and published by Nintendo in 1996. It now spans video games, trading card games, animated television shows and movies, comic books, and toys. Pokemon is the second best-selling video game franchise, behind only Nintendo's Mario franchise, and the highest-grossing media franchise of all time.
</p><p>
Concept:<br>
Tajiri first thought of Pokemon, around 1989, when the Game Boy was first released. The concept of the Pokemon universe, in both the video games and the general fictional world of Pok√©mon, stems from the hobby of insect collecting, a popular pastime which Pokemon executive director Satoshi Tajiri enjoyed as a child. 
</p><p>
Players are designated as Pokemon Trainers and have three general goals: to complete the regional Pokedex by collecting all of the available Pokemon species found in the fictional region where a game takes place, to complete the national Pokedex by transferring Pokemon from other regions, and to train a team of powerful Pokemon from those they have caught to compete against teams owned by other Trainers so they may eventually win the Pokemon League and become the regional Champion.
</p><p>
These themes of collecting, training, and battling are present in almost every version of the Pokemon franchise, including the video games, the anime and manga series, and the Pokemon Trading Card Game.
