The Audra Show is a comic series by Audra Stang that takes place in the fictional town of Star Valley, GA. Instead of telling a single over-arching story, the Audra Show jumps between the lives of several characters over several decades. Beyond the geography, these stories are unified by intimate drama, sincere humor, and a good dose of magical realism. Audra’s art is emotive and vibrant, quickly drawing you into the mundane and fantastic world of Star Valley!

The Audra Show doesn’t star a character named Audra, rather it’s the work of cartoonist Audra Stang. Though she’s obviously behind the scenes and her characters are right there in front, I would say that the Audra in the title of the book is apt since Stang’s sensibility is not one that hides behind the work. It’s right out in front on parade in these three issues alongside the characters. It’s the atmosphere her characters exist in and it delivers some unexpected and mysterious comics that grab your attention.

The first issue of The Audra Show focuses on Owen Minnow, who works at a fast-food restaurant in Star Valley, Georgia in 1988. He’s not too self-assured, but when he hits it off with Bea Allen on his lunch break after she shows him all her scars, things start to look up. But Owen is a natural-born victim — he gets harassed by his customers at the fast-food place and by a co-worker who can’t let it go that he’s obviously interested in Bea. But in the end, he and Bea bond in an unexpected way with a kind of sweet tolerance for difference that brings this slice of life together rather nicely.
