Man with the Screaming Brain tells the story of a wealthy American businessman determined to exploit the crippled economy of a former Soviet state now torn between communist roots and capitalist greed. In this crumbling Eastern European city straight out of a classic Universal horror film, all anyone wants is a way out, and they'll stop at nothing, not murder, not extortion, not even organ theft, to get it.

Campbell's character hits on the wrong gypsy girl, and finds himself facedown in a ghetto alley with a bullet blown through his head. He ends up a re-animated monster in the grip of a mad scientist determined to get rich off a twisted brain-transplant scheme worthy of Dr. Frankenstein.

This is the version of the script that Campbell wanted to shoot before budgetary constraints forced them to scale back his vision, that original vision is laid out here.
