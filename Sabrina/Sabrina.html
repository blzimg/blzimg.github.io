Sabrina the Teenage Witch is a comic book series published by Archie Comics about the adventures of a fictional American teenager named Sabrina Spellman. Sabrina was created by writer George Gladir and artist Dan DeCarlo, and first appeared in <a href="Sabrina13.jpg">Archie's Madhouse #22</a> (Oct. 1962) "Presenting Sabrina the Teen-Age Witch". 
</p><p>
Meet Sabrina, a sexy teen witch who lives a typical teen-age life -- except that her job is to hex her fellow teens. She introduces us to the rules of witchery: witches can't cry, can't sink when they're in the water, and if they ever fall in love, they lose their powers. First appearance of Sabrina, her cat Salem, and Della the Head Witch.
</p><p>
Much of this early version of Sabrina appears to be based on the play and film <a href="Sabrina14.jpg">"Bell, Book and Candle"</a> starring Kim Novak. The rule about witches losing their powers if they fall in love and the inability of witches to cry (both of which were dropped in subsequent versions of Sabrina) were used in "Bell, Book and Candle," and Sabrina's cat Salem is similar to Pyewacket, the witch's familiar in "Bell, Book and Candle."
</p><p>
Storylines of the character at elementary-school-age also appear under the title "Sabrina -- That Cute Little Witch" in almost all of the Little Archie comics.
</p><p>
The series' premise is that Sabrina, a "half-witch" – her mother is an ordinary human, or "mortal" as witches refer to them, while her father is a warlock – lives with her two aunts, Hilda and Zelda Spellman, both witches themselves, in the fictional town of Greendale, which is located somewhere near Riverdale, the home of Archie Andrews. Also living with the three women as the family pet is Salem Saberhagen, a witch who has been turned into a cat as punishment for world domination attempts. Sabrina's primary romantic interest is her mortal boyfriend Harvey Kinkle who, like nearly all the other mortals in Sabrina's world, is unaware his girlfriend is a witch.
</p><p>
Most of Sabrina's adventures consist of Sabrina either trying to use her powers in secret to help others – witches generally are not allowed to tell mortals about their abilities or existence – or dealing with the day-to-day trials of being a teenager. A recurring theme in Sabrina's stories is her learning more about the proper use of her powers, either through her aunts or from trips to a magical dimension that is the home of various magical/mythological creatures, including other witches. Various names are given to this dimension; the mid-late 2000s comics refer to it as the "Magic Realm," while the live-action sitcom referred to it as the "Other Realm".
</p><p>
The comic's characters have also appeared in various other media formats. The <a href="Sabrina5.jpg">1996 live-action sitcom</a>, in which Sabrina discovers her powers at the age of sixteen, aired for seven seasons on ABC and the WB. The unofficial pilot of the series was the <a href="Sabrina4.jpg">1996 TV movie</a> Sabrina the Teenage Witch in April. The movie, produced by Viacom and Hartbreak Films and aired on Showtime, starred Melissa Joan Hart as the title character, Sabrina Sawyer, and Charlene Fernetz and Sherry Miller as Sabrina's aunts Zelda and Hilda, respectively. When the television series debuted on ABC later that year, Hart became Sabrina Spellman, and Caroline Rhea and Beth Broderick replaced Fernetz and Miller. In 2000, the show was dropped by ABC and picked up by The WB. When viewership began to wane, the show was canceled after seven seasons.

Earlier, there had been an animated series produced by Filmation Associates. Another format was a series of paperback novels written by various authors, including Nancy Holder, Diana G. Gallagher, and Mel Odom, as well as a late 1990s/early 2000s animated series set in the original Archie Comics continuity, where Sabrina already knows about her powers while in junior high.

Chilling Adventures of Sabrina is an American supernatural horror web television series developed by Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa for Netflix, based on the Archie comic book series of the same name. The series is produced by Warner Bros. Television, in association with Berlanti Productions and Archie Comics. Aguirre-Sacasa and Greg Berlanti serve as executive producers, alongside Sarah Schechter, Jon Goldwater, and Lee Toland Krieger.
</p><p>
The series is centered on the Archie Comics character Sabrina Spellman, portrayed by Kiernan Shipka, and also stars Ross Lynch, Lucy Davis, Chance Perdomo, Michelle Gomez, Jaz Sinclair, Tati Gabrielle, Adeline Rudolph, Richard Coyle, and Miranda Otto. Originally in development during September 2017 at The CW, the series was intended to be a companion series to Riverdale; however, in December 2017, the project was moved to Netflix with a straight-to-series order, consisting of two seasons. Filming takes place in Vancouver, British Columbia, where both parts of the first season were shot back-to-back. The first ten episodes were released on October 26, 2018.
