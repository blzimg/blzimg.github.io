Featuring appearances by Sandman and all his siblings. In an original story that parallels the events of SANDMAN: SEASON OF MIST, the minions of Hell end up in Death's apartment. Sisters Delirium and Despair decide to throw a party for the dead - which quickly gets out of control. It's up to Dream's older sister, Death, to figure out how to save the day and the afterlife...not to mention the carpet.
