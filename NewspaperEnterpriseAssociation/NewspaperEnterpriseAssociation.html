<h1>Newspaper Enterprise Association</h1>
<p>
The Newspaper Enterprise Association (NEA) is an editorial column and comic strip newspaper syndication service based in the United States and established in 1902. The oldest syndicate still in operation, the NEA was originally a secondary news service to the Scripps Howard News Service.

NEA later evolved into a general syndicate best known for syndicating the comic strips:

<li>Our Boarding House
<li>Freckles and His Friends
<li>The Born Loser
<li>Frank and Ernest
<li>Captain Easy
<li>Wash Tubbs

Along with United Feature Syndicate, the NEA was part of United Media from 1978 to 2011, and is now a division of Andrews McMeel Syndication. The NEA once selected college All-America teams, and presented awards in professional football.
