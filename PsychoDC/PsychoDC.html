When a flying terrorist attempts to assassinate the president on Air Force One, it becomes clear that super-humans are living WMDs. A government agency is formed to monitor these "Psychos." Jake Riley is an agent assigned to watch them, but when he's betrayed by his own agency and his life is destroyed, Jake's only option is to become the very thing he hates: a Psycho.
</p><p>
For the last several years, Riley has been an agent of SIN (the Super-Intelligence Network). He works hard, but it's a dead-end job and Riley knows it, because all the really good assignments go to the FCOs, the Freelance Costumed Operatives...a.k.a. the Psychos, for their wild, super-powered and unpredictable - albeit effective - methods. 
</p><p>
When Riley runs afoul of SIN, he's targeted by his own agency and, in order to survive, he's forced to become what he most hates...THE PSYCHO. Armed with specially designed body armor that gives him superhuman speed and reflexes, the hunter becomes the hunted...a one-man task force determined to eliminate SIN. Written by James D. Hudnall, with fully painted art by Daniel Brereton. Painted cover by Brereton.
