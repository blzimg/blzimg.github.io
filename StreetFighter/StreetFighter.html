Street Fighter is a fighting video game franchise developed and published by Capcom. The first game in the series was released in 1987. Since then, five other main series games, as well as various spin-offs and crossovers, have been released. Street Fighter II is credited with establishing many of the conventions of the one-on-one fighting genre. The game's playable characters originate from different countries around the world, each with a unique fighting style.

The franchise has sold 40 million software units and over 500,000 arcade hardware units. It is one of the highest-grossing video game franchises, with Street Fighter II estimated to have grossed over $10 billion in revenue. Street Fighter remained Capcom's second biggest franchise behind Resident Evil as of 2014, and is currently Capcom's third best-selling software franchise behind Resident Evil and Monster Hunter.
