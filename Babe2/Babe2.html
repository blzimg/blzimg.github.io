The response to Babe was so strong, she just had to make a second appearance. And she does, literally coming together again in the wilds of Queens to face the shifty Shrewmanoid and his legion of giant cyborg alligators! Up from the depths of the sewers and out of the pages of Monkeyman &amp; O'Brien comes this cantankerous creature crew! Will the bodacious Babe halt the musty menace before civilization as we know it is in dire need of a bath?

 Look, down in the sewers! It's a rat! It's a cave! It's giant cyborg alligators! Babe descends into the muck-encrusted world of the flushed and forgotten to catch the sinister Shrewmanoid and his malodorous mutants! Will she stop them from carrying out their evil plan du jour, or will she become an appetizer for the alligators?! It's Byrne at his best: fantastic, fun, and furious! Featuring a special guest appearance by Abe Sapien of Hellboy.
