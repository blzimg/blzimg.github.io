The One was a six-issue comic book limited series distributed by Epic Comics in 1985â€“1986. It was written and drawn by Rick Veitch. It is an ambitious and bizarre fantasy-adventure involving monstrous superheroes, the Cold War, and spiritual evolution.
</p><p>
At the height of the cold war, a madman tricks the United States and the Soviet Union into launching their missiles and super-hero agents against each other. But instead of nuclear Armageddon, the act releases the secret cosmic potential of the human race.
</p><p>
The One begins with the United States and the Soviet Union pushed into World War III by a certain blonde billionaire who has figured out how to turn a profit from a limited nuclear exchange. But the threat of Armageddon awakens a mysterious force in the human race that disarms the missiles and sets the world on a high-speed collision course with evolution.
</p><p>
Finding themselves stripped of their atomic arsenals, both the American and Russian governments unleash top secret super-soldier projects to wage hand to hand combat against each other. The ensuing "Superior War" makes nuclear weapons seem like mere child's play.
