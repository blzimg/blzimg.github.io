This is it, the first issue of the Uncanny X-Men, and even in the beginning, there was Magneto, the Earth's most powerful super villain. Conceived by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, this first issue will always remain one of the core books within the Marvel Comics mythos. This is Stan and Jack making history and legend, although no one knew it at the time.
