Created by: Jack Kirby<br>
Publisher: 1963 - current Marvel<br>
Series: is such a big mess, I'm dumping them all here, except <a href="../AgeOfApocalypse/AgeOfApocalypse.html">Age of Apocalypse</a> which is a separate X-Men ball of mess, and <a href="../XmenTeenTitans/xmenteentitans.html">X-Men Teen Titans</a> because that is a Marvel DC crossover and it deserves it's own.<br>
<p>
About: Created by writer Stan Lee and artist/co-writer Jack Kirby, the characters are among the most recognizable and successful intellectual properties of Marvel Comics, appearing in numerous books, television shows, films, and video games.
</p><p>
The X-Men are mutants, a subspecies of humans who are born with superhuman abilities. The X-Men fight for peace and equality between normal humans and mutants in a world where antimutant bigotry is fierce and widespread.
</p><p>
#1 Story: After a day of training and meeting Jean Grey, a new student at Professor X's school, the X-Men go one their first assignment, stopping a mutant named Magneto from talking over an Air Force base.
