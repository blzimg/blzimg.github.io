There are no super-heroes in this three-issue limited series, just everyday heroes playing their parts in a post-9/11 world. The hype for 411 – which grew out of an e-mail exchange between Joe Quesada (Daredevil) and Mark Millar (The Ultimates) – indicated that the series celebrates peacekeepers, those who stand up for peace in spite of the odds against them.
