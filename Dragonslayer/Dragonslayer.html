Dragonslayer is a 1981 American fantasy film directed by Matthew Robbins, from a screenplay he co-wrote with Hal Barwood. 
</p><p>
It stars Peter MacNicol, Ralph Richardson, John Hallam and Caitlin Clarke. Paramount Pictures handled North American distribution, while Buena Vista International handled international distribution. 
</p><p>
The story, set in a fictional medieval kingdom, follows a young wizard who experiences danger and opposition as he attempts to defeat a dragon.
</p><p>
A co-production between Paramount Pictures and Walt Disney Productions, Dragonslayer was more mature than most other Disney films of the period. Because of audience expectations for a more family-friendly film from Disney, the film's violence, adult themes and brief nudity were somewhat controversial at the time, even though Disney did not hold US distribution rights, which were held by Paramount. The film was rated PG in the U.S.
</p><p>
It's possible that this film was responsible for Disney's later creation Touchstone Pictures to produce more mature fare, starting with 1984's Splash.

Dragonslayer Magazine, collects Dragonslayer (1981) #1-2. Based on the screenplay by Hal Barwoods and Mathew Robbins. Adapted by Dennis O'Neil. Art by Marie Severin and John Tartaglione. When the land falls under the shadow of the last dragon, the people turn to the last surviving wizard for help. When tragedy befalls the kind old magic-user, his quest is passed down to his apprentice, a young man with little knowledge in the ways of sorcery and even less in the ways of battle. Can Galen find the courage and strength to become the world's last "Dragonslayer?!" Based on the classic sword &amp; sorcery movie.
