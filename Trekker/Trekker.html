The story centers around Mercy St. Clair, a young, troubled bounty hunter working the streets of New Gelaph. Her skills are unmatched but her stubbornness and tough exterior tend to hold back her personal relationships. When we first meet Mercy she is scraping by on bounties from tracking down criminals the over-taxed police canâ€™t reach.

As the series progresses, Mercy's journeys carry her farther from her home city into blasted wastelands, other cities and the stars. As her world expands, she becomes aware of the forces that shape her role in the greater playing field of interstellar human society. In the midst of this morally ambiguous and complex universe, Mercy gets the sense that she has a larger role to play.
