Becky Cloonan (1980) is an American comic book creator, known for work published by Tokyopop and Vertigo. In 2012 she became the first female artist to draw the main Batman title for DC Comics. Becky Cloonan was born in Pisa, Italy. She went to New York's School of Visual Arts, which offered the kind of rigorous training that Cloonan had been searching for. She still felt drawn to comics, and she surrounded herself with classmates who also adored the medium. She and her friends decided to produce a comics anthology that they called Meathaus.
</p><p>
Cloonan created minicomics and was part of the Meathaus collective before collaborating with Brian Wood on Channel Zero: Jennie One in 2003. Since then, her profile (and workload) has steadily risen; her best-known work to date has been the twelve-issue comics series Demo (2004), also with Wood. Wizard named Demo its 2004 "Indie of the Year." The series was also nominated for two Eisner Awards in 2005, for Best Limited Series and Best Single Issue or One-Shot.

Cloonan's first solo graphic novel, East Coast Rising Volume 1, was released by Tokyopop in 2006. East Coast Rising: Volume 1 marked Cloonan's third Eisner Award nomination in 2007, this time for Best New Series.
