Pac-Man is arcade game released in 1980 by Namco and published in North America by Midway.
</p><p>
Namco, Midway and Bandai Namco Entertainment have released numerous sequels and spin-offs, many of which have also been remade on multiple platforms, including home consoles and handheld devices. The first sequels were primarily released in arcades, while later titles were released on video game consoles.

Immensely popular from its original release to the present day, Pac-Man is considered one of the classics of the medium, and an icon of 1980s popular culture. Upon its release, the game and, subsequently, Pac-Man derivatives, became a social phenomenon that yielded high sales of merchandise and inspired a legacy in other media, such as the Pac-Man animated television series and the top-ten Buckner and Garcia hit single "Pac-Man Fever". Pac-Man was popular in the 1980s and 1990s and is still played in the 2010s.
