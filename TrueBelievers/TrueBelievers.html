True Believers is an American comic book limited series from Marvel Comics, written by Cary Bates, with art by Paul Gulacy. It is also the name of an obscure group of Spider-Man villains.
</p><p>
The series involves a team of new characters digging into the background goings-on in the Marvel Universe. The team is led by Payback, Mavis Trent, a S.H.I.E.L.D. data analyst.
</p><p>
Though a mini-series, True Believers is unusual in that each issue contains a central plot that is resolved by the end. Issue 1 features the team ending an underground fight club. This club is run by rich and powerful men who pay to have women abducted, drugged and forced to fight one another.
