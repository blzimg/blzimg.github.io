Warhammer 40,000 is a miniature wargame produced by Games Workshop, the most popular miniature wargame in the world. The first edition of the rulebook was published in October 1987. The latest edition is the eighth, which was published in June 2017.
</p><p>
As in other miniature wargames, players enact a battle between opposing forces using miniature models of warriors and fighting vehicles (effectively toy soldiers). The playing area is a tabletop model of a battlefield, comprising models of buildings, hills, trees, and other terrain features. Players take turns to move their model warriors around the battlefield and pretend that they are attacking the other player's warriors. These imaginary fights are resolved using dice and simple arithmetic.
</p><p>
Warhammer 40,000 is set in the distant future, where a stagnant human civilization is beset by hostile aliens and malevolent supernatural creatures. The models in the game are a mixture of humans, aliens, and supernatural monsters, wielding futuristic weaponry and magical powers.
</p><p>
Warhammer 40,000 has spawned a number of spin-off tabletop games. These include Battlefleet Gothic, which simulates spaceship combat; and Space Hulk, which simulates combat within the confines of derelict spacecraft. It has also spawned a large number of video games, such as the Dawn of War series. Finally, it has spawned a large body of novels and comic books, which develop the fictional setting in detail. 
</p><p>
Warhammer 40,000 is set mostly in the 41st millennium (roughly 38,000 years in the future). Although Warhammer 40,000 is mostly a science-fiction setting, it also adapts a number of tropes from fantasy fiction, such as magic, supernatural beings, daemonic possession, and races such as Orks and Elves; "psykers" fill the role of wizards in the setting. The setting of this game shares many tropes with Warhammer Fantasy (a similar wargame from the same company), but their respective settings aren't actually connected. This game is not supposed to be a sequel to Warhammer Fantasy.
</p><p>
The setting of Warhammer 40,000 is violent and pessimistic. It depicts a future where human scientific and social progress have ceased, and human civilization is close to collapse due to war with hostile alien races and occult forces. It is a setting where the supernatural is usually untrustworthy if not outright malevolent. There are no benevolent gods or spirits in the cosmos, only daemons and evil gods, and the cults dedicated to them are growing.
</p><p>
Because the setting of Warhammer 40,000 is based on a wargame, the spin-off novels and comic books are mostly war dramas, and the protagonists are usually warriors of some sort (the most popular are the Space Marines). A key theme of the setting is that the galaxy is overwhelmed by war. Most planets in the Imperium of Mankind are either a warzone or heavily burdened by wartime taxation, and civil liberties are heavily curtailed in the name of security.
