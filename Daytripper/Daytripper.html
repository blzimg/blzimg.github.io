They were two of Entertainment Weekly's Top 100 stars to watch. They've won multiple Eisners and have worked with the top names of comics and pop culture from Joss Whedon (Sugar Shock) and Mike Mignola (BPRD: 1947) to Gerard Way (Umbrella Academy) and Matt Fraction (Casanova). Now, Brazilian wonder twins Fábio Moon and Gabriel Bá are back writing and drawing in a hauntingly lyrical series set in their native Brazil. With DAYTRIPPER, they follow in the tradition of Craig Thompson, Paul Pope and David Mazzucchelli - cartoonists at the top of their game making comics about the quiet moments that ask big questions. 
</p><p>
Brás de Oliva Domingos is an obituary writer with a famous father, a career he hates, and tons of questions. How does a person become a successful writer? How does a man get out of his father's shadow? But those concerns will dwarf the surprise he'll find in the first issue - a twist both he and readers will never see coming, which will grow into a mystery about the meaning of life itself.
</p><p>
While traveling through idyllic rural Brazil, Bras and his best friend Jorge are having the time of their lives. Staring nature in the eye, learning more about the local people and customs - life is good and the future is bright. But when Bras meets the incredibly sultry Olinda, suddenly nothing is so certain anymore.

'I hate you, you piece of s---!' Those were her last words before she left him. If all we need is love, how do we keep going once we lose it? To find out, Bras' father will take him to the desert and take Bras' best friend to an art show.
