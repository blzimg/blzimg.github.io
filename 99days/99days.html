At the 2008 Comic-Con International Karen Berger outlined plans for a new "sub-imprint" called Vertigo Crime: "it's a line of graphic novels, in black and white, hardcover". It was launched in 2009 with two titles: Brian Azzarello's Filthy Rich and Ian Rankin's Dark Entries, the latter featuring John Constantine. Each volume features a cover illustration by Lee Bermejo. Vertigo Crime was ended as a sub-imprint in 2011.

99 DAYS is the story of Antoine Boshoso Davis, who is living the dream as a rookie homicide detective for the LAPD. But 12 years ago he was living a nightmare. As a young Hutu in Rwanda, Antoine was forced to become a child soldier with the rebel Hutu militia. Like so many others he was caught up in the slaughter of a country gone insane, murdering scores of men, women and children with a machete.

Antoine eventually fled Rwanda to LA, was raised by an adoptive family into a quiet, sensitive man with a deep need for justice, so he joined the LAPD. But when a serial killer starts stalking the African American residents of LA, murdering them with a machete, Antoine discovers that his past has come back to haunt him.
