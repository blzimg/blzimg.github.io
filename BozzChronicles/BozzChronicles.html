The series was set primarily in Victorian era England and centered on the crime-solving adventures of "Bozz", an alien with a long tail and an unpronounceable name who crash-landed on Earth. Bozz partners with prostitute Amanda Flynn and American Salem Hawkshaw to solve crimes as a means of stimulating his mind and avoiding suicidal thoughts brought on by ennui. Most mysteries presented in the series were paranormal or speculative in nature, for example, resurrection, death rays, and portals to hell.
