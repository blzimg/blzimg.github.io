Joseph Shuster (July 10, 1914 â€“ July 30, 1992) was a Canadian-American comic book artist best known for co-creating the DC Comics character Superman, with writer Jerry Siegel, in Action Comics #1 (cover-dated June 1938).
</p><p>
Shuster was involved in a number of legal battles over ownership of the Superman character. His comic book career after Superman was relatively unsuccessful, and by the mid-1970s Shuster had left the field completely due to partial blindness.
</p><p>
He and Siegel were inducted into both the comic book industry's Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame in 1992 and the Jack Kirby Hall of Fame in 1993. In 2005, the Canadian Comic Book Creator Awards Association instituted the Joe Shuster Awards, named to honor the Canada-born artist.
</p><p>
Shuster modelled the hero on Douglas Fairbanks Sr., and modelled his bespectacled alter ego, Clark Kent, on a combination of Harold Lloyd and Shuster himself, with the name "Clark Kent" derived from movie stars Clark Gable and Kent Taylor. Lois Lane was modelled on Joanne Carter, a model hired by Shuster. She later married co-creator Jerry Siegel in 1948.
</p><p>
<li>In 1985, DC Comics named Shuster as one of the honorees in the company's 50th anniversary publication Fifty Who Made DC Great.
<li>In 1992, Shuster was inducted into the Will Eisner Award Hall of Fame.
<li>In 2005, Shuster was inducted into the Joe Shuster Canadian Comic Book Creator Hall of Fame for his contributions to comic books.
<li>The Joe Shuster Awards, started in 2005, were named in honor of the Canadian-born Shuster, and honor achievements in the field of comic book publishing by Canadian creators, publishers and retailers.
<li>In Toronto, where Shuster was born, the street Joe Shuster Way is named in his honor.
<li>On September 10, 2013, the Gary Dumm and Laura Dumm "A Love Letter to Cleveland" murals are unveiled on the Orange Blossom Press building near the Cleveland West Side Market, that includes a homage to Siegel and Shuster.
<li>Amor Avenue in Cleveland's Glenville neighborhood was renamed "Joe Shuster Lane".
