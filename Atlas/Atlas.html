Series: 4 issue mini series<br>
Illustrator: Bruce Zick<br>
Writer: Bruce Zick<br>
Publisher: 1994 Dark Horse<br>
<p>
Issue #1: Bruce Zick resurrects the legend of Atlas and pits the mighty titan against the wrath of the gods.
</p><p>
Issue #2: Atlas battles the monster, Sh'en Chui, and eventually defeats it with the help of GoldenRod. As it turns out, this is just the first in a series of battles Atlas will have to face in order to secure earth from the wrath of his enemies. In this issue, we also see the creation of Atlas' idyllic Mythic Oasis, the return of his arch-nemesis, Bol, from a millennium-long hibernation, the revelation of the Seven Mythic Wonders, and our first glimpse at the ethereal home of the Gods -- Eternia. Eventually, though, the most troubling aspect of Atlas' banishment to earth becomes readily evident -- GoldenRod is losing power! 
</p><p>
Issue #3: After Atlas announces to the world the locations of the remaining "God-Symbol" sites, he realizes that only his fellow god, Aox, can help him recharge the dangerously impotent GoldenRod. A boat trip to the Arctic, a glimpse of the mysteriously non-dormant remains of the monster, Sh'en Chui, Aox and Troy's great voyage to the Underworld and the Continuum Well, and an enraged Neo and his nefarious deal with Bol, fill out the action in this issue. By the end, we're left to witness a broken and defeated Atlas, wondering if this is the end.
</p><p>
Issue #4: Atlas has to come to grips with his limitations, and without GoldenRod to aid him in his efforts to defeat the evil Bol and his minions, there may not be much hope for humanity. Aox and Troy's quest to the frozen Arctic to replenish GoldenRod with energy from the Continuum Well ultimately proves successful, but a great sacrifice is necessary in order to achieve their goal. In the end, much is gained, but much is lost. And earth will never be the same again.
