<h2>Amazing Adventures / Fantasy</h2>

With issue #15 (Aug. 1962) Amazing Adult Fantasy was retitled Amazing Fantasy. This issue's lead feature introduced the superhero Spider-Man, written by Lee and drawn by Ditko, although Lee rejected Ditko's cover art and commissioned Jack Kirby to pencil a cover that Ditko inked. As Lee explained in 2010, "I think I had Jack sketch out a cover for it because I always had a lot of confidence in Jack's covers." 
</p><p>
In numerous interviews Lee has recalled how the title had been slated for cancellation, and so with nothing to lose, publisher Martin Goodman reluctantly agreed to allow him to introduce Spider-Man, a new kind of superhero, one who would be a teenager, but not a sidekick, and one who would have everyman doubts, neuroses and money problems. However, while this was indeed the final issue, its editorial page anticipated the comic continuing and that "The Spiderman... will appear every month in Amazing."
</p><p>
Regardless, sales for Amazing Fantasy #15 proved to be one of Marvel's highest at the time, so the company launched the series The Amazing Spider-Man seven months later.
</p><p>
The DVD release of the collector's edition of the Spider-Man movie included an electronic copy of Amazing Fantasy #15. In 2001, Marvel published the 10-issue historical overview The 100 Greatest Marvels of All Time, with Amazing Fantasy #15 topping the list.
</p><p>
In 2008, an anonymous donor bequeathed the Library of Congress the original 24 pages of Ditko art for Amazing Fantasy #15, including Spider-Man's debut and the stories "The Bell-Ringer", "Man in the Mummy Case", and "There Are Martians Among Us".

In September 2000, Metropolis Comics in New York City brought the only known CGC-graded 9.6 (near-mint plus) copy to market and sold it for $140,000. In October 2007, a near-mint copy sold for $210,000 in an online auction on ComicLink.com and in 2017 a NM- 9.2 sold on ComicLink.com for $460,000. Price results accelerated leading up to the Spider-Man: Homecoming movie and a CGC 8.0 sold for three times the price it has ever sold for before when it hit $261,000 in a ComicLink.com auction in May 2017.
</p><p>
A near-mint CGC-graded 9.6 copy sold for $1.1 million to an unnamed collector on March 7, 2011, making the issue one of only three comic books to have broken the million-dollar mark (the others being the debut of Superman in Action Comics #1, of which three copies have sold for more than $1 million each; and the first appearance of Batman in Detective Comics #27). In June 2015, a record price of $200,000 was paid for an example of Amazing Fantasy #15 in CGC 9.0 condition on ComicLink.com.

THE STORY:
</p><p>
Peter Parker is rousted out of bed by his Uncle Ben, and he joins his Aunt May and uncle for a breakfast before heading off to school. At school, it's obvious that he achieves high marks in academics, but when he tries to ask classmate Sally out for a date, she rebuffs him in favor of Big-Man-On-Campus Flash Thompson. The "cool kids" at school ridicule Peter's bookworm qualities, and he goes off on his lonesome to an exhibit showcasing new experiments in radioactivity. While Peter gazes at the display of radioactive ray beams, a spider winds down its strand between opposing bands of radioactive fire before landing on Peter's wrist and biting him.
</p><p>
Peter is unnerved by the spider bite, and on the way home wanders in front of a car that nearly hits him, but he manages to leap out of the way and cling to the side of a sheer wall! It dawns on Peter that he suddenly has incredible powers. He continues to climb up the wall to the roof, accidentally crushes a steel pipe in his bare hand, and shimmies down a narrow cable "as effortlessly as a spider". Peter is convinced that it's the bite of the radioactive spider that has given him the speed, strength and agility of a giant spider. 
</p><p>
To test his strength further, he takes part in a wrestling match where participants can win $100 for staying in the ring for three minutes against Crusher Hogan, a giant wrestler. Peter disguises himself with a mask so he won't be the object of ridicule should he fail, and once he enters the ring, he tosses Crusher Hogan around as if he was a doll. He easily wins the cash prize and gains the attention of a TV producer.
</p><p>
Peter takes charge of his newfound powers, and in order to develop a cool persona to go with them he knits a spider-flavored costume and develops a set of web-shooters which discharge a "spider-web" solution. During his first show on television, the newly anointed "Spider-Man" is a showman, performing many amazing tricks, all leaving the crowd breathless. He takes all the attention and adulation with a bit of an arrogant streak; in fact, when a burglar races down the hallway, pursued by a policeman, Spider-Man cannot be bothered to do anything about it. The burglar makes a clean getaway, and Spider-Man tells the pursuing cop that he's not interested in doing anything other than looking out for number one!
</p><p>
Back at the Parker home, Peter is given a brand new microscope by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben to help him with his scientific studies. As time goes on, Spider-Man's popularity grows due to his TV appearances. As he returns home one night from a public appearance, Peter sees police cars around his home. He's informed that his Uncle Ben has been shot dead by a burglar. 
</p><p>
Peter races to put on his Spider-Man costume to exact revenge, and heads out to the old ACME warehouse where the police have the bad guy cornered. He locates the burglar in the dim recesses of the huge warehouse and chases him into a corner. He shoots his webs at the burglar's gun, gumming it up so it cannot fire. Then he punches his lights out with his spider-powered strength, and when he gets a close look, he realizes the identity of this anonymous burglar: it's the man he could have stopped, the burglar the policeman was chasing at the TV studio!
</p><p>
Spider-Man does his job and hands the burglar over to the custody of the police, but as Peter Parker, he can only rue the day he didn't make the decision to do good instead of doing nothing. 
</p><p>
"And a lean, silent figure slowly fades into the gathering darkness, aware at last in this world, with great power there must also come great responsibility."
