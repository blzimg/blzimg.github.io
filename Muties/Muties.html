<p>
Muties is a six issue miniseries from Marvel Comics which ran from February to July 2002.
</p><p>
It focused on six different Mutants, and each story was essentially self-contained. The miniseries was supposed to show the day-to-day sufferings of mutants, not just those that managed to find their way to the X-Men and Charles Xavier. It was written chiefly by Karl Bollers with different artists doing different issues.
