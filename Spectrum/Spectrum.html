</p><p>
Believing that there was a tremendous amount of high-quality fantastic-themed art work created each year that somehow wasn't being represented in other annual art books and shows, Spectrum was established in 1993 by Cathy Fenner and Arnie Fenner with the intent of providing creators with a regular showcase for the best fantasy, science fiction, horror, and otherwise uncategorizable artwork created each year.
</p><p>
A Call For Entries went out to the arts community and the response was overwhelmingly positive. A blue-ribbon jury convened to make selections from the work submitted and the results appeared in the first full color book, Spectrum 1, published by Underwood Books in 1994. A new installment in the Spectrum series has appeared every year since. Unique in its concept, significant in its content, beautifully direct in its execution, Spectrum is designed for readers who want to satisfy their sense of wonder while simultaneously serving as an invaluable resource for art directors, art buyers, and artists from all walks and sensibilities.
</p><p>
The focus isn't the only characteristic that sets it apart from other art annuals: Spectrum was the first to specifically feature categories devoted to 3D, comics, and unpublished works. Likewise, Spectrum was the first book to significantly cut the time between the jury's selection and the appearance of the annual. Spectrum appears within eight months of our jury's selection.
</p><p>
Spectrum is open to every artist who wishes to participate and can adhere to the competition's rules: international entrants are welcome. Students, fine artists, and illustrators are all treated equally. There are no limits on the number of pieces an artist can submit and there is no pre-screening prior to judging.
