About: Angela is a fictional comic book superhero created by author Neil Gaiman and artist Todd McFarlane. She first appeared as a supporting antagonist in McFarlane's creator-owned series Spawn, making her debut in issue #9 in March 1993, and later starring in her own self-titled miniseries. She is an angel and a bounty hunter, working under the auspices of Heaven to oppose Spawn.
</p><p>
Angela was later the subject of a legal battle between McFarlane and Gaiman over the rights to the character, which Gaiman won. Gaiman later sold the rights to the character to Marvel Comics; she was integrated into the Marvel Universe in the 2013 story "Age of Ultron", and her character was expanded upon in the 2014 storyline "Original Sin", where she was established to be the lost sister of Thor.

In 1602: Witchhunter Angela, Angela appears as a hunter of witchbreed (mutants) in the 1602 universe.

Story: <br>
In the altered realms of Battleworld, Angela and Sera are Witch Hunters, the scourges of King James' England, 1602. In a land beset by magic and monstrosity, they seek a new and seductive evil, not witchbreed, but deal-making Faustians, who bargain with ancient creatures for unnatural power!
