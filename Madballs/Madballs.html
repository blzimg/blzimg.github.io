Madballs is a series of toy rubber balls originally created by AmToy, a subsidiary company of American Greetings in the mid-1980s, later being revived by Art Asylum (2007-2008) and Just Play, Inc. (2017â€“present). The toys incorporated gross-out humor in the vein of Wacky Packages and Garbage Pail Kids. Each ball had a character synopsis and an odd name. The toyline was later turned into an animated television series, a series of comics and a video game for the ZX Spectrum, Amstrad CPC and Commodore 64.

The Madballs are accidentally created when falling into RUIN Labs' toxic pond. They quickly befriend Tommy and several other children. Realizing that he is somehow responsible for their creation, Frankenbeans plots with Snivelitch to capture them. Colonel Corn, a corn cob mutated by the RUIN Labs' toxic pod, captures Tommy and the other children. Colonel Corn explains to them that he has been "corn-sidering" taking over the world. Fed up with his constant corn-related puns, the Madballs defeat him by forcing him to pop his kernels. Corn survives as a cob and watches as Tommy and the other kids eat his popped corn.
