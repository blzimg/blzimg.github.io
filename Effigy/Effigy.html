After a sex-tape scandal, former Hollywood child star turned Z-lister Chondra Jackson returns to her hometown of Effigy Mound, IL, to find a seemingly impossible crime - a fresh corpse in an ancient Indian burial site. Even weirder, the murder resembles a scene from an episode of her old TV show, Star Cop, a live-action children's show about a kid detective. As Chondra starts to investigate, she stumbles upon a bizarre cult that worships celebrities as eternal effigies. And these cult members aren't just worshiping - they're also ritually sacrificing anyone who defies their veneration of the beautiful and famous. 
</p><p>
Chondra's probe takes her on a terrifying tour of burial mounds across the world, from Stonehenge to the Nazca Lines of Peru. But what is the link between the cult, Chondra's hometown, and her own bloodline? Will Chondra become the hero detective she played as a childâ€¦or is she in fact the cult's unwitting messiah? EFFIGY is a twisted murder mystery and conspiracy tale that examines celebrity, godhood, and the price of fame.
