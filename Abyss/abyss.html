The crew of Deepcore, an experimental underwater drilling rig, are pressed into service by the U.S. Navy to undertake a rescue mission. Two thousand feet below the surface of the Caribbean is an American nuclear submarine that they need to remove a Trident nuclear missle from before the Russians do. What they discover is not only NTI, non-terrestrial intelligence, but a secret plot by the Navy to use the recovered missle to attack the NTIs with! Will they save the NTIs or be saved by them?
