Alley Oop is a syndicated comic strip created December 5, 1932, by American cartoonist V. T. Hamlin, who wrote and drew the strip through four decades for <a href="../NewspaperEnterpriseAssociation/NewspaperEnterpriseAssociation.html">Newspaper Enterprise Association</a>. Hamlin introduced a cast of characters, and his story lines entertained with a combination of adventure, fantasy, and humor. 
</p><p>
Alley Oop, the strip's title character, was a sturdy citizen in the prehistoric kingdom of Moo. He rode his pet dinosaur Dinny, carried a stone war hammer, and wore only a fur loincloth. He would rather fight dinosaurs in the jungle than deal with his fellow countrymen in Moo's capital and sole cave-town. Despite these exotic settings, the stories were often satires of American suburban life. 
</p><p>
The first stories took place in the Stone Age and centered on Alley Oop's dealings with his fellow cavemen in the kingdom of Moo. Oop and his pals had occasional skirmishes with the rival kingdom of Lem, ruled by King Tunk. The names Moo and Lem are references to the fabled lost continents of Mu and Lemuria.
</p><p>
On April 5, 1939, Hamlin introduced a new plot device which greatly expanded his choice of storylines: A time machine was invented by 20th-century scientist Dr. Elbert Wonmug, who bore a resemblance to the Grand Wizer. The name Wonmug was a bilingual pun on Albert Einstein; "ein" is German for "one", and "Stein" is a type of drinking mug in addition to being the word for "stone". The name of his assistant and rival Oscar Boom is derived from the words Nobel Prize: Oscar = Prize, and Boom after Alfred Nobel (the inventor of dynamite) also pretty girlfriend Ooola's name was the Stone Age predecessor to the phrase "Ooo-la-la."
</p><p>
Oop was transported to the 20th century by an early test of the machine (in the Sunday strip of April 9, 1939). He was not upset by the incident and apparently did not find modern society to be different from his own. He became Dr. Wonmug's man in the field, embarking on expeditions to various periods in history, such as Ancient Egypt, the England of Robin Hood, and the American frontier. Oop met historical or mythical figures as Cleopatra, King Arthur, and Ulysses in his adventures. 
</p><p>
In addition to the time machine, other science-fiction devices were introduced. Oop once drove an experimental electric-powered race car and, in the 1940s, he traveled to the Moon. During his adventures, he was often accompanied by his girlfriend Ooola, and by the sometimes-villainous, sometimes-heroic G. Oscar Boom (G.O. Boom), Dr. Wonmug's rival and occasional partner. Laboratory assistant Ava Peckedge joined the cast in recent years.
