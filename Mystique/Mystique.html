Mystique can be anything you want her to be... In a world of intrigue and seduction, where mutants are feared and hated and the X-MEN are not enough to protect them, Mystique uses her shape-shifting abilities to further her own mutant rights agenda. And to get want she wants, she's not afraid to do WHATEVER's necessary. Mystique's true motives are put to the test in this brand new beginning for the mutant chameleon.
