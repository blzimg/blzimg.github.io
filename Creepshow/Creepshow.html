Creepshow is a 1982 American dark comedy horror anthology film directed by George A. Romero and written by Stephen King, making this film his screenwriting debut. The film's ensemble cast includes Hal Holbrook, Adrienne Barbeau, Fritz Weaver, Leslie Nielsen, Ted Danson and E. G. Marshall, as well as King himself in his film acting debut. The film was shot on location in Pittsburgh and its suburbs, including Monroeville, where Romero leased an old boys academy (Penn Hall) to build extensive sets for the film.
</p><p>
The film is an homage to the EC and DC horror comics of the 1950s, such as House of Mystery, House of Secrets, Tales from the Crypt, The Vault of Horror and The Haunt of Fear. In order for the film to give viewers a comic book feel, Romero hired long-time effects specialist Tom Savini to make comic-like effects.

Creepshow is a graphic novella published by Penguin imprint Plume in July 1982, based on the movie Creepshow (also from 1982). The book's interior art is by Bernie Wrightson with Michele Wrightson, with a cover by Jack Kamen.
</p><p>
Both the movie and the comic book consists of five short stories:<ul>
<li>"Father's Day"
<li>"The Lonesome Death of Jordy Verrill" (aka "Weeds")
<li>"Something to Tide You Over"
<li>"The Crate"
<li>"They're Creeping Up on You"
</ul>
</p><p>
There is no introduction or afterword of any kind, although on the back cover it states "Stephen King conjures up five jolting tales of horror." The short stories "Weeds" and "The Crate" have never been collected in a King book and both remain uncollected.
