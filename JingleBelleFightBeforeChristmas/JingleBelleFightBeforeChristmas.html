Clear the ice! Santa's rebellious daughter returns in this fun-filled winter one-shot. In a follow-up to her classic 'Mighty Elves' tale, Jingle once again takes to the hockey rink in a battle royal with her snow leopard rival Tashi. It's the war to settle the score, or it will be if the girls can stay out of the penalty box long enough to finish the game. Also, romance comes to the North Pole in a tale of love among the lemmings, and Jing endures yet another 'blissful' Christmas Eve in the company of her famous mom and pop.
