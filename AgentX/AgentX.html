About: The series, a pseudo-spin-off of Deadpool, continued the cynical, slapstick, and highly polished action which had characterized its parent series. Nijo was an assassin, mercenary, and agent employed by the telepathic German assassin called the Black Swan. He blamed Deadpool for his brother's death as he was among the targets of Deadpool's apparently successful assassination of the Japanese crime lords named the Four Winds.

#1: Sandi discovers an amnesiac Alex Hayden and trains him, with the help of Outlaw and Taskmaster, to be a mercenary. This story continues from Deadpool (Marvel, 1997 series) #69.
