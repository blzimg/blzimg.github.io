Judge was created to publish Judge magazine, a weekly satirical magazine. It was launched by artists who had seceded from its rival <a href="../Puck/Puck.html">Puck</a>. The founders included cartoonist James Albert Wales, dime novels publisher Frank Tousey and author George H. Jessop.
</p><p>
William J. Arkell purchased the magazine in the middle 1880s. Arkell used his considerable wealth to persuade the cartoonists Eugene Zimmerman ("Zim") and Bernhard Gillam to leave Puck. A supporter of the Republican Party, Arkell persuaded his cartoonists to attack the Democratic administration of Grover Cleveland. With G.O.P. aid, Judge boomed during the '80s and '90s, surpassing its rival publication in content and circulation. By the early 1890s, the circulation of the magazine reached 50,000.
</p><p>
Under the editorial leadership of Isaac Gregory, (1886â€“1901), Judge allied with the Republican Party and supported the candidacy of William McKinley largely through the cartoons of cartoonists Victor Gillam and Grant E. Hamilton. Circulation for Judge was about 85,000 in the 1890s. By the 1900s, the magazine had become successful, reaching a circulation of 100,000 by 1912. Edward Anthony was an editor in the early 1920s.
</p><p>
Harold Ross was an editor of Judge between April 5 and August 2, 1924. He used the experience on the magazine to start his own in 1925, <a href="../NewYorker/NewYorker.html"> The New Yorker</a>.
</p><p>
The success of The New Yorker, as well as the depression, put pressure on the magazine. It became a monthly in 1932 and ceased circulation in 1947.
