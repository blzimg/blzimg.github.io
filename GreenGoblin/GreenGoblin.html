The Green Goblin is the alias of several fictional supervillains appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first and best known incarnation is Norman Osborn, created by Stan Lee and Steve Ditko to be the archenemy of Spider-Man. 
</p><p>
The Green Goblin is a Halloween-themed supervillain whose weapons resemble bats, ghosts and jack-o'-lanterns. Comics journalist and historian Mike Conroy writes of the character: "Of all the costumed villains who've plagued Spider-Man over the years, the most flat-out unhinged and terrifying of them all is the Green Goblin."

The Green Goblin has appeared in his own title in 1995 as well as several films including 2002's Spider-Man as Norman Osborn, and 2007's Spider-Man 3 and 2014's The Amazing Spider-Man 2 as Harry Osborn.
