Betty Boop is an animated cartoon character created by Max Fleischer, with help from animators including Grim Natwick. She first appeared in "Dizzy Dishes" 1930, and appeared in the Talkartoon and Betty Boop film series, which were produced by Fleischer Studios and released by Paramount Pictures. She has also been featured in comic strips and mass merchandising.

A caricature of a Jazz Age flappers like Clara Bow, Helen Kane, and Baby Ester Jones. Betty Boop was described in a 1934 court case as: "combining in appearance the childish with the sophisticatedâ€”a large round baby face with big eyes and a nose like a button, framed in a somewhat careful coiffure, with a very small body of which perhaps the leading characteristic is the most self-confident little bust imaginable". Although she was toned down in the mid-1930s as a result of the Hays Code to appear more demure, Betty Boop became one of the best-known and popular cartoon characters in the world.
