In (2002) Eisner Award winning cartoonist Eric Powell launched ALBATROSS EXPLODING FUNNYBOOKS in an effort to keep his series THE GOON alive when no other publisher wanted it because it was too “different”. But the readers spoke and the Goon quickly became an indy hit and picked up a diehard cult following. 
</p><p>
The Goon found a permanent home and a wider audience with DARK HORSE COMICS, but Eric continued to publish creator owned comics through Albatross. Like his all ages comic CHIMICHANGA and Rebecca Sugar’s PUG DAVIS. (Rebecca followed that up by creating the Primetime Emmy Award nominated Steven Universe for Cartoon Network.) Eric has spent his career creating and promoting the validity and importance of creator owned comics and in 2016 his efforts continue with ALBATROSS FUNNYBOOKS!
