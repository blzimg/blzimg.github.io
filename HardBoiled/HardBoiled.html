1990: He knows exactly who he is and what his job is and why he's killing people- none of it's true, but he knows that, too! Hard Boiled is reality through the eyes of a psychotic cyborg.  Two killing machines battle it out in the heart of Hollywood. Bad day for innocent bystanders. Tax collector... insurance investigator... psychotic cyborg. Whatever his name, whatever his occupation, the watch words for Hard Boiled are "action-packed!"

1997: Second Edition reprint of the 1990 series. Rolling Stone described it as "intricate, kinetic, and thoroughly outrageous!" Now you can experience Geof's art like never before. More than 40% bigger than the original publication and without color or word balloons, it's totally amazing! It's totally mind-blowing! It's totally Darrow!
