The Nobody is a graphic novel created by cartoonist Jeff Lemire. It was first published in a hardcover format by Vertigo Comics in July 2009. It is a retelling of the H.G. Wells novel The Invisible Man, recasting the bandaged stranger as a modern-day drifter. His presence in a small-town American fishing village creates a frenzy that unwraps and exposes the scarred underside to their own secrets. Lemire believed Wells' character was an ideal way to "explore themes of identity, rural life, community and paranoia".

In 1994, the mysterious drifter John Griffen enters the small town of Large Mouth. As he walks through town, the passing townsfolk are shocked and somewhat disturbed by Griffens appearance, as he is wrapped head to toe in bandages and wears pitch-black goggles over his eyes. He eventually reaches the local motel and requests a room, his appearance scaring the inn keeper June Jaques. He eventually forms a friendship with a 16 year old girl and changes her life.
