Black Hole is a twelve-issue comic book limited series written and illustrated by Charles Burns and published first by Kitchen Sink Press then Fantagraphics. It was released in collected form in 2005 by Pantheon Books. The story deals with the aftermath of a sexually transmitted disease that causes grotesque mutations in teenagers. Burns has said that the mutations can be read as a metaphor for adolescence, sexual awakening and the transition into adulthood.
</p><p>
Set in the suburbs of Seattle during the mid 1970s, the story follows a group of teenagers who contract a mysterious sexually transmitted disease referred to as "the Bug," which causes them to develop bizarre unique physical mutations and subsequently become social outcasts, many of them running away from home to live in the nearby woodland.
</p><p>
Focusing on four central characters, the viewpoint changes between (and sometimes within) issues. Chris is a high schooler who contracts the disease from Rob, a popular kid at her school. She immediately feels she has been deceived and stops speaking to him. Around the same time, Keith contracts The Bug from Eliza, a woman he meets while trying to buy cannabis at a friend's house.
</p><p>
Meanwhile, many other teens in the town have contracted the disease, and several of them seek seclusion from society due to the severity of their mutations and build an encampment in the woods outside of town. Chris and Rob eventually renew their friendship, which culminates with Chris running away from home to the encampment in the woods. Rob continues to live with his parents and attends school, visiting Chris daily at the encampment. At the same time, Keith and Eliza drift apart. There is a central campfire at the encampment known as "The Pit", which Chris avoids.
</p><p>
Later, Rob disappears and Chris starts going to The Pit, where she encounters Keith, a regular visitor who brings supplies to the teens. They take a liking to each other, and Keith offers to let her stay at a tract house that he is watching while its owners are on vacation. Chris eventually invites some of the other teens that frequent the pit to stay at the tract house, which they proceed to destroy to Keith's detriment. Eventually Keith and Eliza rekindle their relationship and Chris discovers Rob's fate. This culminates in the remaining central characters leaving the tract house and the town itself.
