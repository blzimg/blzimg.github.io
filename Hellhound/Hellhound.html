Billy the Kid rides again. John Roberts teams up with the notorious outlaw to travel to Mississippi during the turn of the century, where they encounter the despicable Ku Klux Klan. Meanwhile, the villainous Sin plans to make life Hell on Earth.

In the penultimate issue of John Miller's taut Faustian drama, blues musician John Roberts comes to grips with his role as a 'soul taker' for the devil.

It's the pulse-pounding conclusion to this thriller! When a blues musician sells his soul to the devil for fame and fortune, he finds that he got the short end of the bargain when it's time to pay up.
