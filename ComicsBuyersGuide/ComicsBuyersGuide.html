Comics Buyer's Guide, founded in February 1971 by Alan Light under the title The Buyer's Guide to Comics Fandom as a monthly newspaper in a tabloid format. It was the longest-running English-language periodical reporting on the American comic book industry. It awarded its annual Comics Buyer's Guide Fan Awards from 1982 to circa 2010. The publication ceased with the March 2013 issue. The magazine was headquartered in Iola, Wisconsin.

In 1983, The Buyer's Guide was purchased by Krause Publications. Columnists Don and Maggie Thompson were hired as editors. Krause changed the name with their first issue #482 (February 11, 1983) to Comics Buyer's Guide. In July 2002, Krause was acquired by F+W Publications. With issue #1595 (June 2004), CBG changed its format from a weekly tabloid to a monthly perfect bound magazine. On January 9, 2013, Krause Publications announced the cancellation of Comics Buyerâ€™s Guide effective with issue #1699 (March 2013).
