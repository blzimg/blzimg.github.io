Captain Sternn is considered "part Han Solo, part James Garner from The Great Escape". The character, as written by Wrightson, is an amoral space captain whose adventures are set in the future. Sternn is sometimes considered a criminal with charges ranging from rape to piracy. 
</p><p>
He is associated with supporting characters Hanover Fiste and Justin Tyme. He is drawn as a caricature of Superman, although his clothing is different; he wears a pseudo-military uniform. He is always accompanied by a small, levitating one-eyed robot, named Beezer, that is his most faithful companion.

First conceptualized in the late 1970s, Captain Sternn was developed by artist Bernie Wrightson during his time at The Studio. The character's first published adventure was developed for Tyrannosaurus Press in 1977, and was eventually published in 1980 in Heavy Metal Magazine.
</p><p>
Captain Sternn's original story was adapted as the segment "Captain Sternn" of the 1981 film Heavy Metal. He was voiced by Eugene Levy where the rest of the cast in that segment consist of Rodger Bumpass as Hanover Fiste, Joe Flaherty as Sternn's lawyer Charlie, John Vernon as the prosecutor, and Douglas Kenney as the bailiff Regolian. At the end of the segment that wasn't shown in the original printed story, Sternn opens a trap door under Hanover Fiste ejecting him into space.
