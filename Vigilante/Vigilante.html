Vigilante is the name used by several fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. Notable individuals to assume the alias include Greg Saunders and Adrian Chase.
</p><p>
An original incarnation appeared in The CW series Arrow, played by Clayton Chitty and Johann Urb and voiced by Mick Wingert. Adrian Chase also appeared as a separate character, played by Josh Segarra. 
</p><p>
The original version of Vigilante was a western-themed hero named Greg Sanders (later retconned in the 1990s to "Saunders") who debuted in Action Comics #42 (November 1941). The Vigilante had a teen sidekick introduced in 1942, Stuff the Chinatown Kid.
</p><p>
Adrian Chase first appeared as the second version of Vigilante in New Teen Titans Annual #2 (August 1983) by writer Marv Wolfman and penciler George PÃ©rez. Chase was a District Attorney in New York City who went rogue after his wife and children were killed by a gang boss.
</p><p>
The third person to assume the Vigilante identity was Alan Welles, a fellow judge and friend of Adrian Chase. His first appearance was in Vigilante #7, and later in Vigilante #20 as Vigilante. He secretly operated in a much more violent manner, even executing petty thieves. His mental instability eventually led him to gun down police officers and civilians. Chase though felt responsible for this threat and began a long investigation to take down Vigilante, until Chase found out he was Welles, forcing Chase to kill him.
