Some of Us Looking to the Stars<br>
Magneto asks Gambit and his X-Ternals to travel to the world of the M'Kraan Crystal and save the universe. X-Facts: The Dream is Over article about Age of Apocalypse.
</p><p>
Lila Cheney transports the X-Ternals to another galaxy where they face off with the Imperial Guard; When the planet they are on is threatened by the M'Kraan Crystal, the Starjammers beam the X-Ternals out just before the world is destroyed.
</p><p>
The Starjammers take the X-Ternals to the world of the M'Kraan Crystal but when the Shi'ar who protect the crystal attack, Gambit and his pals find their way inside the giant gem (which they have been sent to steal); They meet Jahf, guardian of the M'Kraan, who explains the true nature of their quest and guides Gambit in stealing a shard of the crystal; As the X-Ternals prepare to return to earth, Sunspot explodes from all of the energy he has absorbed in allowing Gambit to fulfill his mission.
</p><p>
The X-Ternals are running through the Morlock tunnels trying to reach Magneto with the shard of the M'Kraan Crystal he needs to defeat Apocalypse but Rictor is hot on their trail and there is a traitor in their midst; Oh, yeah, and they have Magento's son whom they are also trying to save; But, like I said, there is a traitor in their midst and Apocalypse ends up with both the crystal and the child.
