"Beware the Blood Brothers!"<br>
Drax telepathically warns Iron Man about the Blood Brothers, but the two villains are already battling him. The duo renders him unconscious and transports him to Thanos' desert base. Thanos confronts Drax and reveals that he has been monitoring him and simply chose not to interfere. 
</p><p>
On Titan, Mentor prepares to aid Drax. As Iron Man is led into Thanos' base he fights back against the Blood Brothers and evades them. While he is trying to free Drax, Thanos enters and steps on his hand, damaging his right gauntlet. The Blood Brothers recapture Iron Man, but Mentor and ISAAC send a blast of energy from Titan and through Iron Man's unibeam, destroying Drax's manacles. 
</p><p>
Drax and Iron Man quickly best the Blood Brothers. Thanos prepares to destroy his base, but Drax obliterates the self-destruct switch. Iron Man punches Thanos' head, only to shatter it apart, revealing Thanos has gone, leaving a robot duplicate in his place. Suspecting a booby trap, Drax advises Iron Man to exit quickly. The base is destroyed just as they depart. Drax is certain that Thanos still lives and that he will face him again. He thanks Iron Man for aiding the people of Titan.
