With the imminent cancellation of the 2099 sub-imprint, Marvel gathered many of the characters from that continuity into this umbrella title. X-Men 2099, Spider-Man 2099, Doom 2099, Doctor Strange, and a myriad of original characters struggle to achieve their collective goals and win some time in the spotlight in the world at the end of the next century.

Doctor Doom, ever the arrogant megalomaniac, is determined to defeat the alien race that threatens earth with the techno-organic virus by appropriating it for himself. To that end he enlists Miguel Oâ€™Hara, the Spider-Man of 2099.
