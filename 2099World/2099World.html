About: With the imminent cancellation of the 2099 sub-imprint, Marvel gathered many of the characters from that continuity into this umbrella title. X-Men 2099, Spider-Man 2099, Doom 2099, Doctor Strange, and a myriad of original characters struggle to achieve their collective goals and win some time in the spotlight in the world at the end of the next century.
</p><p>
Story: Doctor Doom, ever the arrogant megalomaniac, is determined to defeat the alien race that threatens earth with the techno-organic virus by appropriating it for himself. To that end he enlists Miguel Oâ€™Hara, the Spider-Man of 2099.
