<p>
Lo! A mighty prophet of the unexplained has come forward to search out the truth and light the way for mankind. It's the end of the 19th century and the city of New York has been plagued by fish falling from the sky, strange lights in the night, bizarre collections of microbial goo, and vanishing citizens. It's up to one man to expose the truth behind these events...Charles Fort.
</p><p>
A mild mannered librarian by day, Fort seeks out the truth and exposes the bizarre to the light of day. The real Charles Fort was one of first true investigators of the unusual and the paranormal. In this series, his heretofore unknown adventures can finally be revealed. Part Indiana Jones, part Fox Mulder, his most powerful weapon is his open mind.
