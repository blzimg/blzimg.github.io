Douglas Rushkoff, author of the apt societal commentary Throwing Rocks at the Google Bus, has delved into the fantastic concepts of mysticism, time travel and war with Aleister & Adolf, a graphic novel illustrated by Michael Avon Oeming and published by Dark Horse Comics. The story imagines famed occultist Aleister Crowley using his specific area of expertise to wipe out Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime.
</p><p>
In a story spanning generations and featuring some of the most notable and notorious idealists of the twentieth century, legendary occultist Aleister Crowley develops a powerful and dangerous new weapon to defend the world against Adolf Hitler’s own war machine—spawning an unconventional new form of warfare that is fought not with steel but with symbols and ideas. But these intangible arsenals are much more insidious—and perhaps much more dangerous—than their creators could have ever conceived.
</p><p>
A lot of weird stuff went on behind the scenes during World War Two. Hitler possessed a well-documented fascination with magic and the occult. His quest for the Spear of Destiny is an infamous footnote of the war and hints at a deeper obsession with the arcane than traditional history books would have us believe.

In their new graphic novel from Dark Horse, acclaimed media theorist Douglas Rushkoff (Testament) and award-winning cartoonist Michael Avon Oeming (Powers) embark on a bizarre journey through a dark underworld of ritual sex magic, sigils of power, and magical warfare. Told from the point of view of a young man with special insight into alternative religions, the book explores the power our beliefs have over the world around us and on our own perceptions.
