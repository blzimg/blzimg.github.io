High-school student Tommy Morris attends a party at his friend Pam's house where students prank call a random number and say "I know your secret" and tells the person on the other end to meet them at a local park at midnight. Pam calls a man who replies in a monstrous voice "How do you know my secret?"

Shortly after, Pam disappears mysteriously. With the police not helping, Tommy must work alone to discover who was on the phone that night and what happened to Pam.
