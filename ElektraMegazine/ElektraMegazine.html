Series: 2 issue mini-series reprints, 1996<br>
Publisher: Marvel<br>
<p>
As an introduction to its Elektra title, Marvel reprinted abridged stories that originally appeared in Daredevil #168 to #190 (Also collects The Elektra Saga #1-4, itself a collection of Daredevil #168-190, cha-ching!). These Elektra stories helped build Frank Miller’s reputation and brought Daredevil previously unrealized popularity. Elektra’s story is a moving and tragic drama, though these stories suffer somewhat from the fact that any parts not featuring her have been excluded. Regardless, the power of the story of Daredevil’s first love and most tragic foe is indisputable.
