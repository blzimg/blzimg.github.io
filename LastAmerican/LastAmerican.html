After World War III, United States Holocaust Commander Ulysses S. Pilgrim has the unenviable task of restoring Truth, Justice and the American Way...no matter who he has to kill in the process! Witness the last days of President Sonny Bono and the creation of the Last American Project. Then General Ulysses Pilgrim locates another survivor of the war. Will it be friend or foe? The Blue Ridge Mountains run red as the Last American travels to Virginia in search of fellow survivors. Ulysses Pilgrim, the last American alive after the big War, finds a journal that may prove he isn't the last American.
