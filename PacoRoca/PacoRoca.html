Francisco Martínez Roca aka Paco Roca (1969) is a Spanish strip cartoonist with experience in graphic novels and advertisement illustrations. He's best known for his comic-books like Wrinkles.

I first heard about when Twists Of Fate was published in English by <a href="../Fantagraphics/Fantagraphics.html">Fantagraphics Books</a> in 2018. 
</p><p>
Twists of Fate: Miguel Ruiz is a Spanish veteran exiled in France who was a member of "La Nueve" ("The Nine"), a company of men that went straight from fighting for their homeland in the Spanish Civil War to battles spanning the globe in WWII. Their years-long trek across Europe and Africa was spurred on by their love for their country and their hatred for brutal dictatorships. Roca uses the composite character Ruiz’s "memories" to tell a story that’s an ode to a generation that bravely stood up to, and beat back, violent fascism.

The House: Three adult siblings relive old conflicts as they clear out the family vacation home after their father's death. It is at once deeply personal (dedicated to Roca's own deceased father) and entirely universal. Three adult siblings return to their family's vacation home a year after their father's death. They each bring their respective wives, husbands, and children with the intention to clean up the residence and put it on the market. But, as garbage is hauled off and dust is wiped away, decades-old resentments quickly fill the vacant home. Roca asks what happens to brothers and sisters when the only person holding the family together is now gone.
</p><p>
Winter Of The Cartoonist: Paco Roca investigates the true story of the five cartoonists who responded to the dark times of the Franco regime and poor working conditions at publishing titan, Editorial Bruguera by starting their own magazine, Tio Vivo. The corporation, however, began trying to thwart their efforts, turning their battle into a real-life David and Goliath tale. Roca combines humor, compassion, and narrative mastery with profiles of the artists as they serve as heroes for all of those who have chased a dream, no matter how high the obstacles.
</p><p>
Wrinkles: Two elderly residents of an assisted living facility employ clever tricks to mask their ongoing deterioration, culminating in a riotous nighttime breakout. With echoes of One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Cocoon, Paco Roca's acclaimed graphic novel squarely addresses the fears of growing old in a work of humor, humanity, and sensitivity. Wrinkles was adapted into a successful animated film in 2011 and has won numerous international awards.
