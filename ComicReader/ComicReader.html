The Comic Reader (TCR) was a comics news-fanzine published from 1961 to 1973 by Jerry Bails and from 1973 to 1984 by Street Enterprises. Debuting in the pre-direct market era (before the proliferation of comics retailers), TCR was the first regularly published comics industry news fanzine, and was able to secure many contacts from within the ranks of the larger publishers. As TCR increased in popularity and influence, it was able to attract professional artist to illustrate the covers. TCR also proved to be a launching pad for aspiring comic book creators, many of whom published work in the fanzine as amateurs. Contributors from the world of fandom included founding editor Jerry Bails, key editor Paul Levitz, Paul Kupperberg, Tony Isabella, Byron Preiss, Neal Pozner, Don Rosa, Carl Gafford, and Doug Hazlewood.

The fanzine was founded in 1961 as On the Drawing Board by Jerry Bails, the "Father of Comics Fandom;" changing its name to The Comic Reader in 1962 and being named the official bulletin of the Academy of Comic-Book Fans and Collectors (ACBFC). During its run, TCR won a number of industry awards, including the Alley Award and the Goethe Award/Comic Fan Art Award. In its last incarnation, published by Street Enterprises, it was more professional magazine than fanzine, and was known colloquially as "the TV Guide of the comics industry."

In November 1973, with issue #101, Wisconsin-based publisher Street Enterprises took over TCR, and Mike Tiefenbacher took over as editor. Under Street Enterprises' oversight, TCR changed format to digest size, giving it even more the impression of being "the TV Guide of the comics industry." They began color image covers with issue #138.
