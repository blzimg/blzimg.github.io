Wonder Man (Simon Williams) is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. Created by writer Stan Lee and artists Don Heck and Jack Kirby, he first appeared in The Avengers #9 (October 1964). The character was initially introduced as a rival to Tony Stark and after being imbued with "ionic" energy, became a supervillain who fought the Avengers. After a series of events, Simon Williams was reborn as a superhero joining the team he originally fought against.

Wonder Man debuted in the superhero-team title The Avengers #9 (cover-dated Oct. 1964), but appeared to die in that issue. Four years later, Avengers #58 (Nov. 1968) revisited the events of #9, explaining that the Avengers had electronically saved Wonder Man's mind in a computer.

Wonder Man was not seen again until The Avengers #102 (Aug. 1972), where he made a cameo appearance in a comatose state. Wonder Man's body is revived by the villain Kang in The Avengers #131-132 (Jan.â€“Feb. 1975), and then again by the Black Talon in The Avengers #152 (Oct. 1976), and finally by the Living Laser in The Avengers Annual #6 (1976).

After this last encounter, Wonder Man finally recovers his faculties and joins the Avengers in a full-time capacity in Avengers #160 (June 1977). Wonder Man and his fellow Avenger the Beast were cast as buddies and lovers of nightlife, which would become a fan-favorite dynamic of The Avengers and continue to be used after the two characters left the series.

Marvel Comics' then-publisher Stan Lee said in 1978, "You know, years ago we brought out Wonder Man, and [DC Comics] sued us because they had Wonder Woman, and... I said okay, I'll discontinue Wonder Man. And all of a sudden they've got Power Girl [after Marvel had introduced Power Man]. Oh, boy. How unfair."
