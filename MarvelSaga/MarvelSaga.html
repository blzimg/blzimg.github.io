Marvel Comics presents one of the most unique comics series in the history of the media. This series tells the Official History of the Marvel Universe from the very beginning in chronological order using actual scenes from the comics themselves. 
</p><p>
From Galactus and the enigmatic Watchers to the 1,000-year galactic war between the Kree and Skrull Empires to the Celestials' first visit to a young planet called Earth and the creation of the powerful Eternals and hideous Deviants. Peek in on the Hyborian Age when a mighty barbarian fought terrible wizards to an age when gods walked the earth and names like Hercules became legend. 
</p><p>
From King Arthur's Court to the heroes of the Wild West to the brave men and women that fought in World War II, it is all just prelude to the dawn of the Marvel Age! In this first spectacular issue, witness the origin of the Fantastic Four and their very first harrowing adventure to Monster Island to confront the diminutive Mole Man. Meanwhile, travel north of the border to Canada and watch as inventor James MacDonald plants the seeds of what will become Canada's greatest super heroes. 
</p><p>
Plus, another brilliant man, Henry Pym, makes a startling discover that allows him to shrink down to the size of an "ant!" And, the Fantastic Four come face-to-face with the shape-shifting aliens known as Skrulls for the very first time.
