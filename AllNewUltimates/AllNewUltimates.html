SPIDER-MAN, BLACK WIDOW, KITTY PRYDE, BOMBSHELL, CLOAK and DAGGER officially unite to tackle the vicious, rampant crime wave overtaking Hell's Kitchen. DIAMONDBACK leads the teen gang, the SERPENT SKULLS, as they run West Midtown's drug and weapons trade and deal in murderous citywide terror. Detective Brigid O'Reilly and her anti-gang unit are on the hunt for a serial mask killer called SCOURGE; they get close but not without some casualties. Written by Michel Fiffe, the creator of the acclaimed indie series COPRA.
