The board game Dune was released by Avalon Hill in 1979, followed by a Parker Brothers game Dune in 1984. A 1997 card game called Dune was followed by the role-playing game Dune: Chronicles of the Imperium in 2000. To date, there have been five Dune computer and video games released. Following Dune (1992), the most famous video game adaptation was Westwood Studios' Dune II (1992), which is credited for popularizing and setting the template for the real-time strategy genre of computer games.
