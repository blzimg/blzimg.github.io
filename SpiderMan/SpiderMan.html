Spider-Man is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The character was created by writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Steve Ditko, and first appeared in the anthology comic book <a href="https://blzim.github.io/kb/Creation/AmazingFantasy/AmazingFantasy015.html">Amazing Fantasy #15</a> (August 1962). For more on the comic book series, see <a href="https://blzim.github.io/kb/Creation/AmazingSpider-Man/AmazingSpiderman.html">Amazing Spider-Man</a>.

The first live-action film based on Spider-Man was the unauthorized short Spider-Man by Donald F. Glut in 1969. This was followed by Spider-Man, an American made-for-television film that premiered on the CBS network in 1977. It starred Nicholas Hammond and was intended as a backdoor pilot for what became a weekly episodic TV series.

The rights to further films featuring the character were purchased in 1985, and moved through various production companies and studios before being secured by Sony Pictures Entertainment (Columbia Pictures), who hired Sam Raimi to direct Spider-Man (2002), Spider-Man 2 (2004), and Spider-Man 3 (2007) starring Tobey Maguire. The first two films were met with positive reviews from critics, while the third film met mixed reviews. In 2010, Sony announced that the franchise would be rebooted. Marc Webb was hired to direct, with Andrew Garfield starring, and The Amazing Spider-Man (2012) was released to positive reviews. The Amazing Spider-Man 2 (2014) saw mixed reviews.

In February 2015, Disney, Marvel Studios and Sony announced a deal to share the Spider-Man film rights, leading to a new iteration of Spider-Man being introduced and integrated into the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). This younger version of Peter Parker is played by Tom Holland, and appears in Captain America: Civil War in 2016 (distributed by Disney) and Spider-Man: Homecoming in 2017 (distributed by Sony), before starring in Avengers: Infinity War and its untitled sequel (both distributed by Disney) in 2018 and 2019 respectively. A sequel to Homecoming is also slated for 2019. Captain America: Civil War and Spider-Man: Homecoming were received with positive reviews.
</p><p>
Raimi's trilogy grossed nearly US$2.5 billion worldwide on a $597 million total budget, while Webb's films grossed over $1.4 billion on a $480 million total budget. Spider-Man: Homecoming grossed over $880 million on a $175 million budget. The Spider-Man films are the ninth highest-grossing film franchise, having grossed over $4.8 billion collectively.

The character is conceived as an orphan within the Marvel Universe named Peter Parker being raised by his Aunt May and Uncle Ben in New York City after his parents Richard and Mary Parker were killed in a plane crash. Lee and Ditko depicted the character as having to deal with the normal struggles of adolescence and financial issues with a large array of supporting characters such as J. Jonah Jameson, Daily Bugle editor and smear campaigner of Spider-Man and classmates such as Flash Thompson, Harry Osborn and romantic interests, Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson.

His origin story depicts him as being bitten by a radioactive spider and thus acquiring spider-related power and abilities, such as the ability to cling to most surfaces, shoot spider-webs using wrist-mounted devices of his own invention, which he calls "web-shooters", and react to danger quickly with his "spider-sense", enabling him to combat his many super powered foes, such as Doctor Octopus, Green Goblin and Venom. Also within the origin story, Spider-Man originally uses this power for stardom, but after letting a burglar escape who is responsible for shooting his uncle, he learns to use his power responsibly.

In the 2010s, he joins the Avengers, Marvel's flagship superhero team. Separately, Marvel has also published books featuring alternate versions of Spider-Man, including Spider-Man 2099, which features the adventures of Miguel O'Hara, the Spider-Man of the future, Ultimate Spider-Man, which features the adventures of a teenaged Peter Parker in an alternate universe, and Ultimate Comics Spider-Man, which depicts the teenager Miles Morales, who takes up the mantle of Spider-Man after Ultimate Peter Parker's supposed death. Miles is later brought into mainstream continuity, where he works alongside Peter.

Spider-Man is one of the most popular and commercially successful superheroes. As Marvel's flagship character and company mascot, he has appeared in countless forms of media, including several animated and live action television series, syndicated newspaper comic strips, and in a series of films. The character was first portrayed in live action by Danny Seagren in Spidey Super Stories, a The Electric Company skit which ran from 1974 to 1977.
</p><p>
In films, Spider-Man has been portrayed by actors Tobey Maguire (2002–2007), Andrew Garfield (2012–2014), and Tom Holland, who has portrayed the character in the Marvel Cinematic Universe since 2016. Reeve Carney starred as Spider-Man in the 2010 Broadway musical Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark.
