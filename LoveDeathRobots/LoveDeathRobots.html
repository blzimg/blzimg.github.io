Love, Death & Robots is an American adult animated science fiction anthology web television series on <a href="../Netflix/Netflix.html">Netflix</a>. The 18-episode first season was released on March 15, 2019. The series is produced by Joshua Donen, David Fincher, Jennifer Miller, and Tim Miller. Each episode was animated by different crews from a range of countries. The series is a re-imagining of Fincher and Miller's long in-development reboot of the 1981 animated science fiction film Heavy Metal.

The cast includes Mary Elizabeth Winstead, Gary Cole, Chris Parnell, Omid Abtahi, John DiMaggio, Christine Adams, Josh Brener, Jill Talley, Hakeem Kae-Kazim, Nolan North, Elaine Tan, Aaron Himelstein, Samira Wiley, Stefan Kapičić, and Topher Grace, with Grace and Winstead appearing in live-action roles, rather than animated.

In June 2019, Netflix renewed the series for a second season.

The animated series consists of 18 stand-alone episodes, all under 20 minutes long, and all produced by different casts and crews, though some episodes may share certain crew members. The series title refers to each episode's thematic connection to the three aforementioned subjects, though not every episode contains all three elements.

The project evolved from a late 2000s meeting whereby David Fincher and Tim Miller decided to make a remake of 1981 film Heavy Metal. Announced in 2008, the project was to be produced by Paramount Pictures although Fincher and Miller had trouble getting the funding necessary for the project. According to Miller, after the release of Deadpool, Fincher called Miller saying "OK, so we’re going to use your newfound popularity to get our anthology movie made", only to eventually decide, "Fuck the movie stuff, let’s just take it to Netflix, because they’ll let us do whatever we want." The two noted that the popularity of YouTube during the gestation period caused a change in their thinking with Miller stating "I honestly think that it's funny, because David and I back then would be having the argument of, 'Can people consume media this way?' And now it becomes the argument of, 'Can people consume media any other way?'"
