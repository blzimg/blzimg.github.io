The story revolves around two men, Perry and Gordo, attempting to survive in the wilds of the Pacific Northwest after Seattle is destroyed in a North Korean nuclear attack. Perry is a somewhat introverted computer programmer whilst his longtime friend Gordo works in various "self-employed" fields and is also a drug dealer. 
</p><p>
The story is a masculine character study as the two evolve and adapt to the changes in the post-apocalyptic world. Gordo becomes more amoralistic while Perry learns survival skills. Both have unique personality traits which help them adapt.

The end of every main chapter is followed by a story of the American Founding Fathers. These are somewhat humorous and based on actual events.
