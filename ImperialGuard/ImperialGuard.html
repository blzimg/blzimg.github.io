"Imperious Wrecks!"<br>
In the aftermath of Onslaught, the Imperial Guard are left on Earth to observe and help out since many heroes have disappeared. The Guard find themselves up against a militia group who has it out for super beings but seem to have some pretty super powers of their own. Uncanny X-Men #341 takes place midway through this issue.
