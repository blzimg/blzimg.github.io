Ms. Mystic is a fictional comic book superheroine created by comic book artist/writer Neal Adams. The comic published nine issues between 1982 and 1994. The character's first full appearance was in Captain Victory and the Galactic Rangers #3 (March 1982), published by Pacific Comics. After Pacific published two issues, the character was published by Adams' own company Continuity Comics.

Ms. Mystic is a genuine witch who was burned at the stake during the Salem witch trials (1692â€“1695). Her soul transferred to another plane, and returned to Earth in the modern world. She is strongly concerned with environmental issues. Mystic has long white hair down to her ankles, wears a set of golden spirals in her hair which resemble the insect-antenna of faeries, and her costume is basically a black spandex catsuit created with Zip-A-Tone.

Ms. Mystic is a magician; her ability to wield magic also gives her the power of flight, the ability to summon a sword of light, and undefined "Elemental powers." She can also call upon Mother Nature for assistance. Ms. Mystic once called upon Mother Nature for help, and she responded by creating the superhero team Urth 4. Urth 4 are strongly influenced by the Fantastic Four: a group of four superheroes based on the four classical Greek elements.
