"A Duel of Iron!"<br>
Daniel Rand was reborn in the fires of a dragon's heart in the mystical land of K'un Lun. Now, he is the living weapon known as Iron Fist, finally in his own series. Hot on the trail of Colleen Wing's kidnappers, Iron Fist has come to Stark International seeking answers. Wanted by the police for a murder he did not commit, Danny comes face-to-face with the Invincible Iron Man, and Shell Head is in no mood to give a wanted man the benefit of the doubt. It's the Golden Avenger vs. the Living Weapon.
