The greatest comic book villain of all time returns in his very own adventure! Doom is truth. Doctor Doom has conquered an entire world. What remains for Doom? Faced with revolution and civil war, the metal-faced monarch moves to Planet Doom's core to tap a mysterious energy store. Once there, he absorbs a nearly limitless power source, giving him the power to reshape the planet to match his every whim! 
</p><p>
With ultimate power in his grasp, Doom quickly grows bored, seeking greater challenges, with even greater consequences... like conquering an entire dimension!
