Super Heroes, Sentinels of Liberty since the Second World War---they're the INVADERS, and they're back in this all-new ongoing monthly from writer Allan Jacobsen and artist C.P. Smith. Jim Hammond, the original Human Torch, returns to lead the INVADERS on a covert mission to stop a mysterious terrorist cell from resurrecting the monstrous evil slumbering in the depths of the Arabian Sea.
