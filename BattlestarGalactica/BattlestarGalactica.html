In a distant time and place, a terrible war was waged between man and machine... the humans lost. Now, guided by their last surviving warship,the mighty Battlestar Galactica, a handful of survivors travel through space in search of the lost home of their ancestors, a shining planet known through ancient records, a planet called Earth. The last survivors of the human race are on a quest across the galaxy in search of their ancestral home, a planet called Earth. But a race of machines, the Cylons, is hunting them down and will not stop until every last human has been exterminated!

Battlestar Galactica is an American science fiction media franchise created by Glen A. Larson. The franchise began with the original television series in 1978 and was followed by a short-run sequel series (Galactica 1980), a line of book adaptations, original novels, comic books, a board game, and video games.

A re-imagined version of Battlestar Galactica aired as a two-part, three-hour miniseries developed by Ronald D. Moore and David Eick in 2003. That miniseries led to a weekly television series, which aired until 2009. A prequel series, Caprica, aired in 2010.
