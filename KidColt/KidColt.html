Title in the first few issues changed from "Kid Colt Hero of the West" to "Kid Colt Outlaw", but little else did so they are included here as a set, a hit for over 30 years!

Kid Colt is the name of two fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The first is a cowboy whose adventures have taken place in numerous western-themed comic book series published by Marvel. The second is a cowboy-themed horse-like superhero.
</p><p>
Kid Colt (real name: Blaine Colt) is an American Old West cowboy character who starred in the comic book series Kid Colt Outlaw, as well as in several other titles. He is the longest-running cowboy star in American comic-book publishing, featured in stories for a 31-year stretch from 1948â€“1979, though from 1966 most of the published stories were reprints. A brief publishing hiatus occurred between issues #139 (April 1968) and #140 (Oct. 1969).

Some of Kid Colt's earliest adventures, beginning with Kid Colt Outlaw #14 (May 1951) were written and drawn by Pete Tumlinson. Artist Jack Keller began his long association with the character starting with Kid Colt, Outlaw #25 (March 1953). Marvel editor Stan Lee would later take over writing chores on the title. Cover artists included such notables as Joe Maneely, John Severin, and Russ Heath, until the frequent Marvel cover team of penciller Jack Kirby and inker Dick Ayers took over for the bulk of them from 1959-1965.

Kid Colt and his horse Steel first appeared in Kid Colt #1 (August 1948), from Marvel predecessor Timely Comics. Originally his cover logo was subtitled "Hero of the West" but by issue three this was changed to "Outlaw". His origin, as told in Kid Colt #11 (Sept. 1950), involved Colt being wrongly accused of murder (he killed his father's murderer in a fair gun battle) and becoming a fugitive from the law, along the way engaging in heroic good acts in an effort to restore his reputation. This origin is similar to that of the Rawhide Kid, another Western character from Marvel's 1950s iteration, Atlas Comics.

Kid Colt appeared in numerous series through that decade, including All Western Winners, Wild Western, Two-Gun Western, and Gunsmoke Western. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, he appeared in the reprint title The Mighty Marvel Western along with the Two-Gun Kid and the Rawhide Kid; he additionally headlined the three-issue Giant-Size Kid Colt reprint series. His signature series ended with #229 (April 1979), making it the longest-running Western comic book.

The character has appeared sporadically in Marvel universe superhero titles, usually in stories involving time travel between the current era and Western times. These have included The Avengers #141-43 (1975), The Fantastic Four vol. 3, #33-34 (2000) and The Black Panther vol. 3, #46-47 (2002).

It was not until 2000, with the miniseries Blaze of Glory, by writer John Ostrander and artist Leonardo Manco, that a Western series again featured Kid Colt. The gritty miniseries, which featured different-looking versions of Marvel Western characters and retconned that the naively clean-cut Marvel Western stories of years past were merely dime novel fictions of their actual lives, killed off Kid Colt in the series' conclusion (#4, March 2000). An older version of Kid Colt appears in 'Skaar: King Of The Savage Land, having faked his death and subsequently time-traveling.

Marvel reintroduced Kid Colt as teenager in a 2009 "One-Shot" comic ("Kill the Kid") written by Tom Defalco and illustrated by Rick Burchett (originally published in digital format). The book, narrated by a self-proclaimed drifter named Everett Hawkmore who partners with the Kid, retells a somewhat modified origin story and changes the title character's real name to Blaine Cole. Potential plot threads unrealized in the story include a brother of Cole missing after the raid that killed his parents and a search for a witness to the gunfight that had erroneously branded him an outlaw.
</p><p>
The character also appears in 2010's Rawhide Kid: The Sensational Seven.
</p><p>
During a period where time itself was becoming unraveled, Kid Colt teamed up with the Hulk, Rawhide Kid and Two-Gun Kid to stop a murderous sheriff with time-traveling powers.
