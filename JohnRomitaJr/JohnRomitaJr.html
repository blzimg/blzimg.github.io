John Salvatore Romita, professionally known as John Romita Jr. (born August 17, 1956), is an American comics artist best known for his extensive work for Marvel Comics from the 1970s to the 2010s. He is the son of award-winning artist John Romita Sr.
</p><p>
Having illustrated both gritty street-level stories of characters such as Spider-Man and Daredevil and cosmic stories such as those starring Thor, Romita says he prefers the former, because "that is where I grew up. I use the same approach to each of the different story types – the story tells me what to do." He prefers to work in the Marvel Method. He considers The Man Without Fear to be his best work, due to the strong storytelling and the quality of the story.
</p><p>
John Romita Jr. received an Inkpot Award in 1994. With writer J. Michael Straczynski and inker Scott Hanna, Romita Jr. won a 2002 Eisner Award for Best Serialized Story: The Amazing Spider-Man #30-35: “Coming Home".
