Marvel's massive line-wide cosmic crossover begins! A worldwide rash of alien menaces spreads, threatening to overrun humantiy, not to mention Earth's superhuman community! And as if dealing with the U.S.Agent in his new role as a federal "superhuman sheriff" wasn't enough, the Avengers face a bigger problem in the the person of Ronan the Accuser, who declares that, now and forevermore, Earth shall be a prison planet for the universe's worst criminals!
