Series: 8 issues 1988<br>
Publisher: Epic (Marvel)<br>
<p>
The Shadowline Saga is a comic book imprint from Epic Comics that was published in its original incarnation from 1988 to 1990. It was created and edited by Archie Goodwin.
</p><p>
The Shadowline Saga was Marvel's first attempt at creating a mature-themed line of superhero comics. Further, it was the first line produced by Epic Comics utilizing a pre-conceived shared universe concept. The central concept tied all of the titles together, allowing them to serve as one unified crossover. The line could either be read as individual title(s) or the entire line of titles could tell a much broader story when read together chronologically.
</p><p>
The Shadow Dwellers were a race that were almost human. Their evolution paralleled humanity, though they evolved swifter and a great deal better. Meanwhile, humans evolved in far greater numbers. After reaching maturity, Shadow Dwellers would not age any further, until they had reproduced. This provided a natural balance, preventing their potential immortality from leading to overpopulation.
</p><p>
The original line of The Shadowline Saga titles included:<ul>
<li>Doctor Zero (created by Archie Goodwin) (8 issues)
The most ancient and powerful of the Shadow Dwellers, effortlessly manipulating humanity with his Machiavellian ways.
<li>Power Line (created by Archie Goodwin) (8 issues)
Two young Shadows joined together with the noble goal of balancing Dr. Zero's manipulations with acts of true heroism.
<li>St. George (created by Archie Goodwin) (8 issues)
The Knight of The Order of St. George, a human priest armed with Shadow-designed armor created to prepare its wearer for battles against today's dragons.
