Series: 33 issues 1971-1977, 11 issues 1979<br>
Publisher: Marvel<br>
<p>
An umbrella title that gave an opportunity for lesser known characters a chance to see if they could have their own title. The title was mildly successful, ran for 6 years and put out 33 issues, but took a vacation in 1978 for some reason and came back in 1979 for 11 more issues.
