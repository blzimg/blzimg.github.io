Philip Foglio (born May 1, 1956) is an American cartoonist and comic book artist best known for his humorous science fiction and fantasy art. He attended the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts in Chicago, Illinois, and was a member of the university's science fiction club, art-directing &amp; co-editing the group's fanzine, Effen Essef.
</p><p>
He was nominated for both the Hugo Award for Best Fan Artist and the Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation in 1976, and won Best Fan Artist in 1977 and 1978. After living in the DePaul dorms for a few years, Phil moved to the Rogers Park neighborhood of Chicago, and hosted weekly Thursday Night Meetings of Chicago-area science fiction fans. 
</p><p>
He drew the first known Unix daemons for a limited series of T-shirts in 1979.
</p><p>
Beginning in 1980, Foglio wrote and illustrated the comic strip What's New with Phil &amp; Dixie for Dragon Magazine from TSR Games, satirizing the world of role-playing games.
</p><p>
Foglio illustrated the MythAdventures series of fantasy novels by Robert Lynn Asprin, and later adapted the first book, Another Fine Myth, into an eight-issue comic-book series from WaRP Graphics. The WaRP work eventually led to comic-book assignments from DC Comics (Angel and the Ape, Plastic Man and Stanley and His Monster miniseries), Marvel Comics, and First Comics (back up stories in issues of Grimjack and scripting over Doug Rice's plots in Dynamo Joe). 
</p><p>
He also joined the Moebius theatre group, and held regular meetings and poker parties for the local science fiction community.
</p><p>
In the 1990s, Foglio met and married his wife, Kaja. The two contributed art to the collectible card game Magic: The Gathering, from Wizards of the Coast, and resurrected the comic strip What's New with Phil &amp; Dixie for that company's Duelist magazine. During this decade, Foglio co-founded Palliard Press and published additional comics, including a new Buck Godot series and the whimsical erotic series XXXenophile. The Foglios later founded Studio Foglio and began to produce the steampunk-fantasy series Girl Genius.
