National Comics Publications, Inc.(also known as NCP or simply National) was an American comic book publishing company, and the direct predecessor of modern-day DC Comics. The corporation was originally two companies: National Allied Publications, Inc. (also known as National Allied Newspaper Syndicate, Inc.) which was founded by Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson in autumn 1934 to publish <a href="../NewFun/NewFun.html">New Fun</a>, the first American comic book with all-original material rather than comic strip reprints, and Detective Comics, Inc., formed in 1937 with Wheeler-Nicholson and Jack S. Liebowitz listed as owners.

Despite the official names "National Comics" and "National Periodical Publications", the company began branding itself as "Superman-DC" as early as the 1950s, and it became known colloquially as DC Comics for years before the official adoption of that name in 1977. Founder Major Malcolm Wheeler-Nicholson was a 2008 Judges' Choice inductee into the <a href="../Awards/Awards.html">Will Eisner Comic Book Hall of Fame</a>.
