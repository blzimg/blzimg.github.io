700 A.D.: A legendary Mayan warrior obtained the power of the ancient gods and incurred their wrath. Jump ahead to the year 2065, and the key to that power is about to be rediscovered, awakening the slumbering gods and initiating The Chaak, a tournament to determine the world's champion fighter... and the fate of all mankind! 
</p><p>
The best fighters in the world have begun elimination rounds in the famous Lucha Libre, an anything-goes, winner-takes-all battle for the title of "Champion of the World." Meanwhile, an archeologist studying Mayan culture receives a hallucinatory visitation from an ancient Mayan god warning him of a threat to all mankind, little realizing that the portent is tied to a mysterious invitation being received by the victors in the Lucha Libre...an invitation to the fight to end all fights...The Chaak! 
</p><p>
Ex-fighter Takan makes the fateful decision to visit his former mentor, the legendary, unbeaten champion known as El Charro. But Takan isn't the only one looking for the Charro, Chilbacan, "the snake," the champion's long-time rival, is also on the hunt! The battle that's brewing isn't for prize money or glory, but for revenge. No rules, no weapons barred, no quarter given, this fight's not over until one of the combatants is dead! All this, plus daredevils Mita and Xel take on a motorcycle gang in an illegal bike race trough the streets of Tuxtla!
