What If, sometimes rendered as What If...?, is a series of comic books published by Marvel Comics whose stories explore how the Marvel Universe might have unfolded if key moments in its history had not occurred as they did in mainstream continuity. What If comics have been published in eleven series as well as many stand-alone issues since the 1970s.

The initial 47-issue series ran from February 1977 to October 1984. The first What If story was "What If Spider-Man had Joined the 'Fantastic Four'?". It presented an alternate version of events seen in The Amazing Spider-Man #1 (1963). What If #24, which is titled "What If Gwen Stacy Had Lived?" and focuses on the consequences of Spider-Man's secret identity being publicly exposed, is one of the most highly regarded What If stories.
