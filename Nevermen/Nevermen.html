The greatest heroes who never existed in the mission they never expected: One of the Nevermen is missing, taking with him the only clues to a plot that has the criminal underworld in turmoil. With maniac monkey butlers, disembodied heads, and the mysterious villain known as Clockwork arrayed against them, the remaining Nevermen find themselves seeking the help of one of their former companions now turned free-lance avenger, The Murderist!
