Alice in Sunderland: An Entertainment is a 319 page Graphic Novel by illustrator and writer Brian Talbot. Published in 2007 by Jonathan Cape and Dark Horse.
</p><p>
Written more like a history book than a story, it explores the links between Lewis Carroll and the Sunderland area (North East England), with wider themes of history, myth and storytelling. The art is done in collage or multimedia scrapbook style. 
</p><p>
The book focuses on Sunderland, but also covers other towns and cities in the area, such as Newcastle upon Tyne, Durham and Hartlepool. Local legends and tales are documented, including The Lambton Worm and the monkey hanged in Hartlepool.
</p><p>
It is published in the UK by Jonathan Cape, and in the US by Dark Horse. Jonathan Cape is a division of Pengiun Random House UK, now Bertlesmann. In October 2002 the Bertelsmann conglomerate publicly expressed regret for its "conduct under the Nazis, and for later efforts to cover it up".
