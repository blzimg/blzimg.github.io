Ultraman is a Japanese tokusatsu science fiction television series created by Eiji Tsuburaya. Ultraman is a follow-up to Ultra Q, though not technically a sequel or spin-off. The show was produced by Tsuburaya Productions and was broadcast on Tokyo Broadcasting System (TBS) from July 17, 1966 to April 9, 1967, with a total of 39 episodes (40, counting the pre-premiere special that aired on July 10, 1966).

Although Ultraman is the first series to feature an Ultra-Crusader, it is actually the second show in the Ultra Series. Ultra Q was the first. In fact, Ultraman opens with the Ultra Q logo exploding into the Ultraman logo. Ultraman, and its titular hero, became a major pop culture phenomenon in Japan, spawning dozens of sequels, spinoffs, imitators, parodies and remakes.

Ultraman's central characters were created by Eiji Tsuburaya from Tsuburaya Productions, a pioneer in special effects who was responsible for bringing Godzilla to life in 1954.

STORY: The storyline begins in the near future, as referenced from the mid-1960s. In episode 23, "My Home Is Earth," it is definitively established that the series takes place in the early 1990s with a plaque, shown at the end of the episode, and dated 1993. However, this was later retconned by the introduction of The Return of Ultraman, which takes place in 1971. 
</p><p>
Sinister aliens and giant monsters constantly threaten civilization during this period. The only Earth organization equipped to handle these disasters and menaces is the Science Special Search Party, or SSSP, a special worldwide police force equipped with high-tech weapons and vehicles as well as extensive scientific and engineering facilities; this organization is called the Science Patrol, or the United Nations Scientific Investigation Agency, in the English-dubbed version syndicated in the United States.
</p><p>
The branch of the Science Special Search Party that is focused on in the series is located in Tokyo, Japan. Led by Captain "Cap" Toshio Muramatsu, the Science Special Search Party is always ready to protect the Earth from rampaging monsters, but sometimes it finds itself outclassed.
</p><p>
One day, Shin Hayata, the Patrol's most capable member, was patrolling near a lake when he witnessed a space monster named Bemular, who had come to Earth in an orb of blue energy, being chased by an orb of red energy. Hayata also gave chase to Bemular, but the orb of red energy collided with Hayata's ship, causing both to crashland and killing Hayata in the process. 
</p><p>
Ultraman, who was generating the red orb, felt guilty for killing the capable scientist/soldier, and to make up for the terrible thing he had done, chose to revive Hayata in exchange for him becoming his host, who would contain him while he was on Earth. From that day forward, Ultraman staunchly defended Earth against aliens and monsters, with Hayata and the SSSP assisting him.
</p><p>
After Ultraman appeared, he would fight the threat until it was defeated, and he would then fly away to revert to his host. Ultraman's victory was never assured, however, as Ultraman's powers and, indeed, his very life force, came from rapidly depleted solar energy, which was heavily reduced by Earth's sunlight-filtering atmosphere.
</p><p>
When Ultraman first appears, his "Color Timer," or "warning light," is always a rich cyan color. As time goes on, the Color Timer turns solid red, and then starts to blink, giving off a warning chime as it does so. When Ultraman runs out of energy, the Color Timer goes out and turns black. Ultraman's Color Timer is linked directly to his heart, and damaging it will cause mortal injury or serious pain to Ultraman.
</p><p>
In the series finale, a race of aliens named the Zettonians, and their vanguard kaiju, Zetton, attack. Ultraman appears to fight Zetton, but before Zetton is defeated, he mortally wounds Ultraman with a weapon he had not expected that damages his Color Timer/warning light, causing him to lose almost all his energy instantly.
</p><p>
When Zoffy, Ultraman's superior, comes to retrieve the fallen hero, Ultraman pleads for Hayata's life and offers his life completely, so that Hayata may live as a normal man. Zoffy then says he has brought two life-forces and that he will give one to Hayata. He then separates them, giving Hayata new life, but Hayata seems to have no memory between the time he first collides with Ultraman's ship (in the first episode), and he is shown standing outside the Science Special Search Party Headquarters, holding the Beta Capsule but apparently not knowing what it is or what it does. 
</p><p>
Fuji comes to his aid, as Hayata watches Zoffy take Ultraman home. This is a rather different finish to the series than stated in the English dub, which states both that Ultraman will return and that Hayata retains not only his Beta Capsule but also, apparently, his full memories of all his experiences as he awaits Ultraman's return. The latter ending appears to have been adopted by Tsuburaya as the definitive ending, as Hayata reappears several times throughout the series as Ultraman's host in times of need.
