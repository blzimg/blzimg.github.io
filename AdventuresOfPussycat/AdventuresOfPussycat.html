About: The Adventures of Pussycat was a one-shot comics magazine that reprinted the risque, black-and-white feature that ran throughout various men's adventure magazines published by Martin Goodman's Magazine Management Company in the 1960s. The feature's creative staff came largely from Magazine Management's sister company, Marvel Comics following the success of Harvey Kurtzman and Will Elder's color comics feature "Little Annie Fanny", published in Playboy magazine from 1962 to the 1980s.
