Plenty of comics deal with religion, including the pop-star cosmology of The Wicked + The Divine, the apocalyptic prophecies of East of West, the blasphemous absurdity of Battle Pope and the John Wayne-flavored sacrilege of Preacher. 
</p><p>
Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon’s classic series about a wayward holy man imbued with the power of a minor deity had a lot to say about Texas and God, two huge entities that also figure into the new Image series God Country, written by Donny Cates and illustrated by Geoff Shaw with colorist Jason Wordie. 
</p><p>
Cates and Shaw have crafted a take on religion and family that’s personal and compelling, and it’s little surprise that Marvel reunited the pair on Thanos. Despite its larger-than-life scale, God Country feels like a very personal story about sticking by family members, even when all logic would say it’s time to let go.
