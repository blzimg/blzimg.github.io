After saving Midnight City from the twisted machinations of mutant villains, the Nevermen return to their lives as everyday citizens, unaware that an even greater threat stirs far below the city streets. He calls himself Winterbone, and he's closer to the Nevermen than any of them could possibly imagine. Streets of Blood, the followup to last year's critically-acclaimed thriller, answers questions and reveals secrets about the enigmatic protectors of the innocent. Phil Amara and Guy Davis are cooking up a story that's got more twists than a lime-rickey.
