The world of 2099 is a cyberpunk dystopia, similar to the world of Blade Runner. North America is a corporate police state ruled by a few huge megacorporations, most notably Alchemax, which owns the private police force the Public Eye. Doom 2099, revealed to be, in fact, Victor Von Doom, would take over the United States. Each title had the modifier "A.D." ("After Doom") added on the logo to reflect the change.

This issue came out after <a href="../Doom2099/Doom2099.html">Doom 2099</a> #29, to celebrate Doom's successful invasion of America. Doom 2099 consults with his Black Cabinet. Lohengrin is confronted by Polymire and Septymbre for an alien artifact that can bring back the dead. Hulk 2099 considers using an alien jar to bring Gawain back to life. Doom 2099 recruits Ghost Rider 2099. Spider-Man 2099 is informed of Doom's plans by Punisher 2099. Bloodhawk finds a hidden vault, while Meanstreak and Halloween Jack look for the artifact. Spider-Man, Punisher, X-Men and Ghost Rider come together to stop Septymbre from bringing back Wintre.

In 1996, when Marvel, during a cost-cutting exercise, fired the editor Joey Cavalieri, many of the 2099 creators (including Peter David and Warren Ellis) quit the line in protest and sales slumped.
