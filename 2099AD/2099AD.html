About: The world of 2099 is a cyberpunk dystopia, similar to the world of Blade Runner. North America is a corporate police state ruled by a few huge megacorporations, most notably Alchemax, which owns the private police force the Public Eye. Doom 2099, revealed to be, in fact, Victor Von Doom, would take over the United States. Each title had the modifier "A.D." ("After Doom") added on the logo to reflect the change. 
</p><p>
This issue came out after <a href="../Doom2099/Doom2099.html">Doom 2099</a> #29, to celebrate Doom's successful invasion of America.
</p><p>
In 1996, when Marvel, during a cost-cutting exercise, fired the editor Joey Cavalieri, many of the 2099 creators (including Peter David and Warren Ellis) quit the line in protest and sales slumped.
