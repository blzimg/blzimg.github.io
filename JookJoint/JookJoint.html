JOOK JOINT, 5 issues from 2018 - 2019 by Image Comics, created by by Tee Franklin (BINGO LOVE) and Alitha E. Martinez (Black Panther: World of Wakanda). A dark horror series, filled with blood and revenge, set in the Deep South. 
</p><p>
“As a domestic violence survivor, this is a story I’ve been working on for years," said Franklin. "It’s been extremely cathartic and therapeutic. It was important for me to have an artist who understood what Jook Joint meant to me, before inviting them to embark on this journey with me. I appreciate that Image Comics has allowed me to tackle this subject matter, in addition to working with us on charity variants for Mariska Hargitay’s Healing Heart foundation. I now have an opportunity to use my talents to help survivors like myself. People have helped me when I was going through a rough time in my life and now I want to give back.”
</p><p>
A five issue mini-series by Bingo Love's Tee Franklin and World Of Wakanda's Alitha Martinez, the series saw two issues published in October and November of last year, but there had been no sign of the third issue, solicited for December. Issue #3 solicitations had been updated to be published in February, and then March 2019, Image Comics and Diamond have removed solicits for #3 and #4 completely.
</p><p>
Issue #1 introduces Mahalia, who runs the hottest spot in all of 1950s New Orleans—The Jook Joint. Here she keeps the jazz popping, people boppin' and the women? The women are to die for. There’s only one rule: “Keep your hands to yourself.” But some men think rules don’t apply to them, and Mahalia and her coven of slain women enjoy reminding them that they most certainly do.
</p><p>
Issue #2: Tonight at the Jook Joint, the blood runs as hot as the music as Mahalia and her coven face an attack at the bar. Meanwhile, young mother Heloise has the chance to get away with murder. Will she use it, and take revenge on her sadistic husband?
</p><p>
Issue #3: Now it's Heloise's turn to show her husband how it feels to be beaten! It's the 1800s, and Mahalia gives us a glimpse into her past—and why revenge is important. Plus, this issue includes an original backup story by SHAWN PRYOR (F.O.R.C.E.) and GEORGE KAMBADAIS (THE DOUBLE LIFE OF MIRANDA TURNER)!
</p><p>
Issue #4: Mahalia makes a house call. Meanwhile, Heloise must deal with the consequences of her revenge-seeking.
