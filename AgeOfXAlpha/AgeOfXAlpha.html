About: The various X-Men characters tell stories about how they came to be living on Fortress X, revealing a world unlike the normal X-Men universe, one where mutants have been more aggressively hunted and characters' histories have been changed. They are waiting for a final attack on their sanctuary from the outside world, then the attack begins.
