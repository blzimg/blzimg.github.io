"The Coming of the Hulk."<br>
It's the height of the Cold War and the government is about to test their new Gamma Bomb. Unfortunately, a carefree and oblivious teenager named Rick Jones wanders out onto the test area. Dr. Bruce Banner, the creator of the Gamma Bomb, rushes out to warn the young man away. However, the bomb explodes and as Banner pushes the teenager to safety he is caught in the heart of a Gamma maelstrom. 
</p><p>
The gamma-rays that bombard Banner's taunt frame transform his physiology. Now, whenever Banner becomes angry he transforms into the man-brute known as the Incredible Hulk. Feared by the public and hunted by the army, the Hulk becomes one of the most tragic figures in Marvel's history. General "Thunderbolt" Ross will not rest until the Hulk is destroyed. 
</p><p>
The creature's only allies are Rick Jones and Betty Ross, Thunderbolt's daughter and Banner's one true love. Thus begins the epic saga of the world's mightiest mortal. 
</p><p>
NOTE: Notice that the Hulk was colored grey for the first few issues of his series. In an interview, Stan Lee (creator) said very simply that the reason for this was that grey was the easiest color for the copiers of the time to print. When the technology got better the Hulk became green, and according to Stan, for no better reason than they didn't have a green hero in their stable yet.
