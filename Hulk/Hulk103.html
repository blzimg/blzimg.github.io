And Now...the Space Parasite!<br>
Watching a TV show about the menace of the Hulk, the evil Space Parasite decides to make a pit-stop on earth to suck up all of the jade giant's powers to fuel his plans for interplanetary conquest. The Hulk battles the Parasite but the fight is ultimately determined by members of the Parasite's home planet who recognize him as a menace and blow up his space ship. The Hulk is gassed by New York's finest and is captured.
