"This World Not His Own!"<br>
Bruce Banner is falling down a bottomless pit back to Midgard when the Enchantress plucks him back to Asgard out of curiosity. The Warriors Three consult Oldar the Oracle and find out the origins of the Hulk. Captured by Enchantress and Executioner, Banner transforms into the Hulk which enrages the Executioner who has fought the jade giant before (back in TTA #77). Leaving the Hulk behind, the evil duo lead an army of trolls against Asgard and the Hulk arrives on the scene just in time to lend a hand in the victory of Odin's forces.
