Max Fleischer (July 19, 1883 – September 25, 1972) was a Polish-American animator, inventor, film director and producer. Born in Kraków, Poland, Fleischer became a pioneer in the development of the animated cartoon and served as the head of Fleischer Studios, which he co-founded with his younger brother Dave, in the United States. He brought such animated characters as Koko the Clown, Betty Boop, Popeye, and Superman to the movie screen and was responsible for a number of technological innovations including the Rotoscope, the "Bouncing Ball" song films, and the "Stereoptical Process".

Fleischer produced his Out of the Inkwell films featuring "The Clown" character, which originated from his youngest brother Dave, who had worked as a sideshow clown at Coney Island. It was the one of the later tests made from footage of Dave as a clown that interested Bray. Out of the Inkwell featured the novelty of combining live action and animation and served as semi-documentaries with the appearance of Max Fleischer as the artist who dipped his pen into the ink bottle to produce the clown figure on his drawing board. While the technique of combining animation with live action was already established by others at the Bray Studio, it was Fleischer's clever use of it combined with Fleischer's realistic animation that made his series unique.

Fleischer invented the "Follow the Bouncing Ball" technique in his Ko-Ko Song Car-Tunes series of animated sing-along shorts. In these films, the lyrics of a song appear on screen and theater patrons are encouraged to sing along with the characters. An animated ball bounces across the top of the lyrics to indicate when words should be sung.
</p><p>
Of the 36 Song Car-Tunes 12 used the deForest Phonofilm sound-on-film process, the first of which was My Old Kentucky Home in 1926. This preceded Walt Disney's Steamboat Willie (1928), which has been erroneously cited for decades as the first cartoon to synchronize sound with animation. The Song Car-Tunes series lasted until early 1927 and were interrupted by the bankruptcy of the Red Seal company—just five months before the start of the sound era.

Max Fleischer's most famous character, Betty Boop, was born out of a cameo caricature in the early Talkartoon, Dizzy Dishes (1930). Fashioned after popular singer Helen Kane, she originated as a hybrid poodle/canine figure and was such a sensation in the New York preview that Paramount encouraged Fleischer to develop her into a continuing character. 
</p><p>
Fleischer's greatest business decision came with his licensing of the comic strip character Popeye the Sailor, who was introduced to audiences in the Betty Boop cartoon short, Popeye the Sailor (1933). Popeye became a box office hit and was one of the most successful screen adaptations of a comic strip in cinema history. 
</p><p>
During its zenith by the mid-1930s, Fleischer Studios was producing four series, Betty Boop, Popeye, Screen Songs, and Color Classics, resulting in 52 releases each year.
</p><p>
Jonathan Swift's classic, Gulliver's Travels, was a favorite of Max's and pressed into production. Fleischer and Paramount originally budgeted the film at $500,000—the same miscalculation made by Disney with Snow White. The final cost for Gulliver's Travels was three times, or $1.5 million. It played limited engagements in only 30 theaters during the Christmas season 1939 and made $3 million, giving Paramount a profit of $1.5 million before going into foreign release. 
</p><p>
The cost for the Superman series has been grossly overstated for decades, based on Dave Fleischer's 1968 interview. The actual figure stated in Fleischer's contract was in the $30,000 range, twice the cost of a Popeye cartoon. Superman was a reflection of the type of "serious" cartoons that were not being made by rival studios. Their science fiction fantasy elements appealed to Max's interests, finally leading the studio into maturity and relevance for the 1940s.
