"Once a Hero: Part 1!" Story by J.M. DeMatteis. Art by Steve Leialoha. In a bygone era, a Golden Age, he was the greatest super hero around. Now, in the Modern Era, as times and taste change, Captain Justice attempts to find his place in this brave new world.

If Captain Justice cant get the world to believe in him, then he will once again fade away into imagination. But if saving the world from super villains isn't enough, what is?
