The Marvel Universe meets Lord of the Rings and unleashes a new team of costumed adventurers.
</p><p>
In the far-off realm of Eurth, a deadly experiment is underway, one that could have dire ramifications for our world. There, in this place of fantasy and magic, the legendary Captain Avalon has gathered a band of hauntingly-familiar yet totally new characters to meeet the challenge of the Dreadlord!
</p><p>
Standing against his dark power are the roguish archer Blackthorn; the roughneck Greenskin Smashtroll (who can't seem hold his meade); Warmaker, the middle-aged master of battle; the half-man/half-beast Nighthowl; Ironheart, the tragic knight; the flame-golem Scorch; Duke Ctranj, the mage of Avalon, and more! 
</p><p>
When Captain Avalon's son is abducted, these defenders of the realm must embark on a perilous quest to seek his return.
