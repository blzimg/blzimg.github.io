Skylanders is a toys-to-life action video game series published by Activision. Games in the series are played by placing character figures called the Skylanders on the "Portal of Power," a device that reads the figures' tags through NFC and "imports" the character represented by the figure into the game as a playable character.

Near-field communication (NFC) is a set of communication protocols that enable two electronic devices, one of which is usually a portable device such as a smartphone, to establish communication by bringing them within 4 cm of each other. NFC devices are used in contactless payment systems, similar to those used in credit cards and electronic ticket smartcards and allow mobile payment to replace/supplement these systems. 
</p><p>
A few of the Skylanders available for play include Spyro the Dragon and Cynder, both of which were previously included in The Legend of Spyro series. Skylanders is otherwise unrelated to the series.
</p><p>
The game's setting takes place in a world called Skylands, a realm filled with adventure and floating islands. It is the very center of the universe where it is constantly threatened by evil forces who seek to rule Skylands and gain access to all worlds. Luckily, a band of heroes called the Skylanders use their abilities and machinery to defend their world from various threats, which they have done for generations. 
</p><p>
They worked with the Portal Masters in keeping peace and balance in Skylands, battling the forces of evil, and protecting the Core of Light. The Skylanders have an unbreakable bond with their Portal Masters. Though they are not servants, the Skylanders chose to serve their Portal Master and do so eagerly. Each Skylander is associated with one of the ten elements of Skylands: Earth, Air, Fire, Water, Magic, Tech, Life, Undead, Light, or Dark.
