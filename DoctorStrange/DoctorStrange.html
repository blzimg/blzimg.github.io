Doctor Strange serves as the Sorcerer Supreme, the primary protector of Earth against magical and mystical threats. Inspired by stories of black magic and Chandu the Magician, Strange was created during the Silver Age of Comic Books to bring a different kind of character and themes of mysticism to Marvel Comics.
</p><p>
The character's origin story indicates that he was once an egotistical surgeon. After a car crash severely damages his hands and hinders his ability to perform surgery, he searches the globe for a way to repair them and encounters the Ancient One, the then-holder of the title Sorcerer Supreme. 
</p><p>
After becoming one of the old Sorcerer Supreme's students, Strange becomes a practitioner of both the mystical arts and the martial arts. He has a suit consisting of two main relics, the Cloak of Levitation and the Eye of Agamotto, which give him added powers. 
</p><p>
Strange is aided along the way by his friend and valet, Wong, and a large assortment of mystical objects. He takes up residence in a mansion called the Sanctum Sanctorum, located in New York City. Later, Strange takes the title of Sorcerer Supreme to help to defend the world against future threats.
