The underground comics movement in the late 1960s with titles like "the Fabulous Freak Brothers", "Zap", and "Weirdo", Marvel takes a stab at making an "underground" comic book.

</p><p>
Comix Book is an underground comic book series published from 1974â€“1976, originally by Marvel Comics. It was the first comic of this type to be published by a mainstream publisher. 
</p><p>

Edited by Denis Kitchen, Comix Book featured work by such underground luminaries as Justin Green, Kim Deitch, Trina Robbins, Art Spiegelman, and S. Clay Wilson. 
</p><p>
While it did not depict the explicit content that was often featured in underground comix, it was more socially relevant than anything Marvel had previously published.
