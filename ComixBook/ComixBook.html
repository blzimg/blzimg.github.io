Edited by Denis Kitchen, Comix Book featured work by such underground luminaries as Justin Green, Kim Deitch, Trina Robbins, Art Spiegelman, and S. Clay Wilson.

While it did not depict the explicit content that was often featured in underground comix, it was more socially relevant than anything Marvel had previously published.
