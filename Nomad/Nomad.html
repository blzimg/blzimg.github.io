Nomad is the name of several fictional characters appearing in American comic books published by Marvel Comics. The Nomad name and costume were created by writer Steve Englehart and artist Sal Buscema as an alternate identity for the original Captain America, Steve Rogers, in Captain America #180 (December 1974).
</p><p>
The identity was revived by writer J. M. DeMatteis for a minor character named Edward Ferbel in Captain America #261-263 (September - November 1981). The same writer later gave the title to its best known claimant Jack Monroe in Captain America #281 (May 1983). Other claimants of the code name are Rikki Barnes and Steve Rogers's adopted son Ian Rogers.
