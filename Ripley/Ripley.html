Issue #3: Human Nature<br>
Human Wonders, the third installment of the Ripley's Believe It Or Not! series focuses on human oddities throughout history. Narrated by the original Siamese Twins, this issue covers human hyperbole's, including the world's fattest twins, and explores the bizarre human afflictions that produce dog-faced boys and elephant men. Though disturbing and stark, Human Wonders attempts to prove how those who appear less than human can actually be so much more than the rest of us.
