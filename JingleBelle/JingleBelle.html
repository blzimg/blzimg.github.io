"A Very Special Jingle Belle Special"<br>
Jingle Belle is once again trying to sell her life story as the unsung hero of the holiday season. After several failed attempts Jingle thinks she finally found a way to correct past mistakes. She once again defies Santa's "no publicity" edict and signs with a cartoon producer to make an all-new animated special. But she soon finds herself facing adversaries even more dangerous than the Blizzard Wizard and his snow monsters, contemporary TV executives! 
</p><p>
The "Polly Green Backup Story" finds Jingle's gal pal Polly Green, fledgling Halloween witch, in quite a predicament. Her family is demanding that she use her magic to conjure up elaborate gifts for them and Polly is sick of being used. Determined to teach her greedy family a lesson, Polly gives one gift to everyone and turns their home into a huge gingerbread mansion. It isn't long before Polly's family falls under the spell of the house and devour it, becoming hideously fat. Polly's relatives beg her to magically make them thin again, but Polly says there's only one way they can shed those holiday pounds: lots and lots of exercise!
