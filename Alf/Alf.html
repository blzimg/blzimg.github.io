About: Comic book version of the TV sitcom and cartoon that aired on NBC from 1986 to 1990.
</p><p>
Gordon Shumway, a friendly extraterrestrial nicknamed ALF (Alien Life Form) from the planet Melmac, follows an amateur radio signal to Earth and crash lands in the San Fernando Valley area of California, and the garage of the suburban middle-class family the Tanners.
</p><p>
The Tanners take ALF into their home and hide him from the Alien Task Force , a part of the U.S. military that specializes in aliens, and their nosy neighbors, until he can repair his spacecraft. 
</p><p>
It is eventually revealed that ALF's home planet Melmac exploded because of a catastrophe involving a nuclear war. In the season one episode "Pennsylvania 6-5000", ALF tries to convince the President of the United States to stop the nuclear program, as ALF fears that Earth might suffer a fate similar to Melmac's. ALF was off the planet when it was destroyed because he was part of the Melmac Orbit Guard. 
</p><p>
ALF is homeless, but he is not the last survivor of his species. He becomes a permanent member of the family, although his culture shock, survivor guilt, general boredom, despair, and loneliness frequently cause difficulty for the Tanners. 
</p><p>
Despite the problems and inconveniences his presence brings into their lives, they grow to love him, though some episodes make it clear they are also afraid of how their lives would be turned upside down if word that he has been living with them gets out.
