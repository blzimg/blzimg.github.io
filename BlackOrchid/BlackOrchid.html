1993 Issue #1:<br>
She can make you do whatever she wants and you'll believe it was your idea. She could be a mystical being, or a scientific oddity. Whatever she is, beware her presence. As the flower's bouquet can captivate a fly, so can Black Orchid control your mind and your soul. 
</p><p>
Reporter Walt Maddocks has made it his business to find people who don't want to be found. His current subject of scrutiny is Flora Black, a woman who briefly achieved fame when she saved a high-profile political candidate from an assassin's bullet. 
</p><p>
No one has seen her since, but Maddocks is convinced that she has connections to a professional escort named Blackie, and just possibly the mysterious Black Orchid. A wise prankster? A naive demigoddess? A corrupting influence or a sweet inspiration? Whatever she is, whatever you might think she is, Black Orchid can change your mind - sometimes forever.
