Series: 7 issues 1990<br>
Publisher: Epic (Marvel) <br>
<p>
The Shadowline Saga is a comic book imprint from Epic Comics that was published in its original incarnation from 1988 to 1990. It was created and edited by Archie Goodwin.
</p><p>
The Shadowline Saga was Marvel's first attempt at creating a mature-themed line of superhero comics. Further, it was the first line produced by Epic Comics utilizing a pre-conceived shared universe concept. The central concept tied all of the titles together, allowing them to serve as one unified crossover. The line could either be read as individual title(s) or the entire line of titles could tell a much broader story when read together chronologically.
</p><p>

The Shadow Dwellers were a race that were almost human. Their evolution paralleled humanity, though they evolved swifter and a great deal better. Meanwhile, humans evolved in far greater numbers. After reaching maturity, Shadow Dwellers would not age any further, until they had reproduced. This provided a natural balance, preventing their potential immortality from leading to overpopulation.
</p><p>

Individually, they were superior but they were no match for the great tide of humankind that came in time to rule the Earth. So they became a shadow race, living among us, speaking our languages, but secretly, eternally apart. Sometimes as protectors, sometimes as predators. Over the centuries, they became the stuff of our legends and our myths. Sometimes heroes. Often monsters.
</p><p>

But as the Twentieth Century moved nearer and nearer its close, the world had shrunk to the point that there was little room for living in secret and the power of humankind had grown to doomsday proportions. There was a more pressing need than ever to emerge, to make themselves felt; to influence, to control the destiny of the planet they shared with us.
</p><p>

Scattered on the Earth, separated from each other by centuries of secrecy and hiding, torn by their own feuds and personal strife, the need to emerge was answered in ways as varied as the people of the shadows themselves varied. But it was answered. By the likes of Doctor Zero, Powerline, and The Order of St. George. Cautiously, recklessly, with responsibility and without, they entered into the mainstream of human life.
