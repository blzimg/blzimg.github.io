There isn't a man, woman, or child walking this earth who hasn't heard of Indiana Jones, the greatest adventurer of all time. Dark Horse Comics has assembled a top-notch team of talent to custom-fit this enigmatic character into an all-new, four-issue comic book series that's as chock-full of characterization as it is excitement! 
</p><p>
It all begins when a mysterious stranger shows up as Barnett College with an ancient key, and Dr. Jones puts down his grade book to go in search of his former archaeological colleague, Sophia Hapgood. Now a trendy psychic, "Madame Sophia" is doing very well for herself by fleecing people out of their hard-earned money. Toss in a tiny minotaur-like statuette, sprinkle in a few overzealous Nazis, and cue the music!
