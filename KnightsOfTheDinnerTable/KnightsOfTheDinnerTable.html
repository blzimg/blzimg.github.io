Based on the real-life drama that happens around an RPG gaming table, Jolly R. Blackburn’s Knights of the Dinner Table is the definition of a cult favorite comic book: little known to the general public, but with a small, reliable and tight-knit fanbase who adores it.

Originally launched in 1990 as a comic strip inside a magazine, Knights of the Dinner Table went from an off-hand story to Blackburn’s big focus. Originally self-published through two successive companies, the comic book series eventually found a long-term home in 1997 with Kenzer &amp; Company

Many of the stories presented in KoDT are based on actual in-game experiences of the developers or readers, who are encouraged to submit story ideas. Part of the comic's popularity stems from the reader's ability to relate to the characters and their experiences. KoDT has won the Origins Awards for Best Professional Game Magazine of 1998 and 1999. KoDT has also won the Origins Award for Best Game Accessory of 2010.
