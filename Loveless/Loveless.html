Wes Cutter is a wanted man running from a violent past: the horrors of the Civil War, a brutal stint in a Union prison camp, and the savage fallout of Reconstruction. Now he's on a quest for the one thing in short supply, peace. Joining Wes is his beautiful wife Ruth, a woman who has been to hell and back herself and hides dark secrets of her own. The road they travel will be a bloody one, leaving a trail of bodies stretching from Missouri to the Pacific Ocean.
