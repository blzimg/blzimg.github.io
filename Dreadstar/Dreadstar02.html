To find out why Willow, the cybernetic telepath on Dreadstar's team, can't reach her full potential, Syzygy mystically bonds their psyches and transports the two of them to a plane of psychic energy and finds out the truth in "Willow's Story." Syzygy brings out the latent telepathic abilities that Willow was suppressing due to her father's molestation of her.
