Grayson is a 2014-2016 spy comic book ongoing series published by DC Comics about the character Dick Grayson leaving behind his superhero life to become an agent of the fictional spy agency Spyral. The series was written by Tom King.
</p><p>
Dick Grayson has taken on a number of roles in his lifetime, from acrobat to super-hero. Now, though, he is a spy. In Russia, he deftly leaps onto the roof of a moving train on the Trans-Siberian Railway. His handler, known as "Matron," informs him that she'll be impressed when he makes it inside - a challenge that will require defeating the gunman who crawls across the roof toward him. From afar, Black Oak reports back to his superiors that the impressive spy who has just defeated a Russian Foreign Intelligence officer atop a train is en route to the asset.
</p><p>
Matron, meanwhile, watches covertly as her target - Ninel Dubov - seems to be showing resistance to her attempt to have him drugged. He has fallen in with an attractive young woman who prevented her from further attempts, and Matron warns that the pair are now heading Dick's way. The young woman leads Dubov to the train's bar, where Dick is already waiting. 
</p><p>
He insinuates himself upon their conversation, trying to woo the girl away from him and then feigning an accidental spill of his wine on her white dress. Hurriedly, the girl rushes to the washroom to clean up and check back in with her partner - who happens to be the spy that Dick knocked out on his way into the train. As she leaves the rest room, the woman suddenly feels faint, and Matron comments that it is because the wine that was spilled on her chest contained a paralytic agent.
