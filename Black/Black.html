1 issue 2017 Black Mask Studio<br>
<p>
Black Mask Studio has long been home to some daring and refreshing series, but this year one of its biggest has been Black, the initially Kickstarter-funded superhero series that imagined a world where only black people could manifest superpowers.
</p><p>
Brutally encapsulating themes like police brutality and racial profiling, aside from telling a thoroughly grounded superhero story, Black paints an astonishingly vivid and at times ugly picture of the trials and tribulations of African-Americans in modern America, using the power and symbology of superheroes to speak to social injustices that are all too real in 2017, and in a rare manner for superhero stories, is refreshingly blunt about highlighting and decrying these injustices as something that exist beyond the pages of comic books.
