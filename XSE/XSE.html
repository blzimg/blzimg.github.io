Revealed: the secrets of the X-Men's soldier siblings, Bishop and Shard! We all know that Bishop is the warrior from the future who traveled through time to fight alongside the X-Men. We also know that his sister, Shard, has done the same to join X-Factor--as a hologram. 
</p><p>
There are, however, many things we don't know: what was their life like as soldiers in the X.S.E.? Why did Bishop abandon the administrative post he worked so hard to attain? How did the feud between Bishop and Fitzroy begin? Why was there friction between Shard and her brother? How did Shard die--only to live again as a hologram?
