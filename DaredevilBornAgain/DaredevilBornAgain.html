Written by <a href="../FrankMiller/FrankMiller.html">Frank Miller</a> and drawn by David Mazzucchelli, "Born Again" is a 1986 comic book story arc that appeared in the Marvel Comics series Daredevil #227–231. It was later reprinted in graphic novel format along with the previous issue #226, and a follow-up story arc from Daredevil #232–233, which resolves some loose ends from the original story arc. Because of this, this follow-up story arc has become generally considered part of "Born Again".
</p><p>
The story details Daredevil's descent into insanity and destitution at the Kingpin's hands, as well as a subsequent struggle to build a new life for himself. Karen Page, the former secretary of the Nelson &amp; Murdock law offices and girlfriend of Matt Murdock, had left years earlier to pursue an acting career. 
</p><p>
After a brief period of success, she became a heroin addict and was reduced to starring in pornographic films in Mexico. Strapped for cash, she sells the information that Matt is Daredevil for a shot of heroin. This information is sold upward to the Kingpin. Over the next six months, the Kingpin uses his influence to have the IRS freeze Murdock's accounts, the bank foreclose on his apartment, and police lieutenant Nicholas Manolis testify that he saw Murdock pay a witness to perjure himself.
