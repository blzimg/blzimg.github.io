A gargantuan monster is tearing apart downtown Tokyo and turning its fair citizens into a menagerie of grotesques! Can anyone stop the carnage? Can anyone save the city? Enter Rusty, the Boy Robot, Japan's biggest big gun! If he can't atomize the atomic monstrosity, nobody can! Or, rather, nobody in the Eastern hemisphere!
