Written by Zeb Wells (New Warriors, Spider-Man/Doctor Octopus: Year One). Illustration by Seth Fisher (Green Lantern: Willworld, Batman: Legends of the Dark Knight). A manic fusion of Marvel super heroes with Japanese pop culture that proves why the FF and Iron Man are big in Japan! It's an all-out romp with big monsters a-go-go as Droom, Giganto and Eerok, the giant ape, along with hundreds of manic '50s Marvel monsters, trample Tokyo's first-ever Kaiju Museum and Celebration!
</p><p>
Mass panic has struck the streets of Tokyo! The media has initiated round-the-clock coverage. Uncontrollable crowds are choking the streets, and kaiju hysteria has gripped the island of Japan for the first time in 50 years! Because the Fantastic Four, the world's first super-hero big-monster battling squad, and playboy industrialist, Tony Stark, have descended on the Land of the Rising Sun!
