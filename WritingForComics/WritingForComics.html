Alan Moore's Writing for Comics is a book published in 2003 by Avatar Press. The master of comic book writing shares his thoughts on how to deliver a top-notch script! It reprints a 1985 essay by Alan Moore on how to write comics successfully that originally appeared in the British magazine Fantasy Advertiser (four chapters from issue #92, August 1985, to issue #95, February 1986). The book consists of four main chapters, it also includes an additional essay by Moore and illustrations by Jacen Burrows.

The first four chapters are dedicated to establishing a beginner guide about writing, storytelling and plotting a comic book script. The last chapter however, written in 2003, aims to provide an X-Treme writing for comics course and advises; "never to get stuck in one writing style, always be open to try new things."
