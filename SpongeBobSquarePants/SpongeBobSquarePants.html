SpongeBob SquarePants is an American animated television series and media franchise that has generated $13 billion, created by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg for Nickelodeon. 
</p><p>
The series chronicles the adventures and endeavors of the title character and his various friends in the fictional underwater city of Bikini Bottom, which was named for the real-life Pacific coral reef known as Bikini Atoll. The series' popularity has made it a media franchise, as well as the highest rated series to ever air on Nickelodeon, and the most distributed property of MTV Networks (Viacom). 
</p><p>
Many of the ideas for the series originated in an unpublished educational comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which Hillenburg created in 1989. He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 upon the cancellation of Rocko's Modern Life, and turned to Tom Kenny, who had worked with him on that series, to voice the title character.

 A feature film, The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, was released in theaters on November 19, 2004, and a sequel was released on February 6, 2015. On June 24, 2017, the series began airing its eleventh season with the episodes 'The Check-Up/Spot Returns.' In May 2017, the show was announced to be renewed for a 12th season.

In February 2011, creator Hillenburg first announced the release of the 32-page bimonthly comic book series, SpongeBob Comics, based on the show. The release marked the first time Hillenburg authored his own books. He said, "I'm hoping that fans will enjoy finally having a SpongeBob comic book from me". The comic book series is published by Hillenburg's production company, United Plankton Pictures, and distributed by Bongo Comics Group.
