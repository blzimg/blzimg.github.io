Kate Kristopher, once the most famous explorer of an Earth far more fantastic than the one we know, is forced to return to the adventurous life she left behind when a family secret threatens to destroy everything she spent her life protecting.
</p><p>
We have a transgender character best friend, a semi-sentient robot cat character, a whole wide world of anthropomorphized animal-human characters, seeming fantasy characters, and presumably all kinds of spectrums and perspectives pertaining to diversity there included.
</p><p>
We move around in time somewhat between main character Kate’s memories of her 7th birthday visiting the Moon with her father and the “present” day when a price seems to have been placed on her head and she’s struggling to survive assassination attempts. As she gradually learns there’s a lot more to her past than she thought, we also learn of her resistance to memories that don’t sit right with her, or information she doesn’t want to know. Kate is part of creating a resistant text for the reader. There are considerable dead zones in information that create the tension of the plot since her family relationships are clearly murderous and dangerous to she and the younger brother she discovers exists.
