His works included many Judge Dredd stories, the origin of Finn, ABC Warriors series and one of Tharg's Future Shocks. He later moved to Marvel UK, for which he drew the mini-series Death's Head II.

He briefly worked on a strip originated by Stan Winston called 'Realm of the Claw'. Later he co-created the Wildstorm series The Possessed with writer Geoff Johns, and a strip for Heavy Metal magazine, entitled "A-crazy-A" featuring Playboy model Tiffany Taylor â€“ for which he provided the art and script. He was also the complete author of the short story "Winter Rose" in the Vampirella magazine. In 2004 Sharp set up his own publishing company, Mam Tor Publishing, with his wife Christina McCormack, to publish the artbook Sharpenings: the Art of Liam Sharp.
