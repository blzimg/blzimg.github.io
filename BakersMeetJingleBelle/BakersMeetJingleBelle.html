When two multi-Eisner-award-winning storytellers bring their funniest creations together, the result is nothing less than pure comics magic.
</p><p>
As the Baker parents try to frantically finish their holiday preparations, they find themselves in dire need of a baby-sitter. 
</p><p>
Enter Jingle Belle, fresh from a Christmas Eve defection from her father, Santa, and looking for a place to hide out. Somewhat skeptical of Jingle's heritage, the Baker kids demand proof so she obliges with a whirlwind sleigh ride to the North Pole. 
</p><p>
Meantime parents Kyle and Liz are dealing with the horrors of last-minute shopping and the now-stranded Santa is mistaken for a prowler as he searches suburbia for both his daughter and his missing sleigh.
