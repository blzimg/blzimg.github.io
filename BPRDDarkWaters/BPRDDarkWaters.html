<p>
Abe Sapien and Roger the Homunculus find a small town in Massachusetts where the perfectly preserved bodies of three puritan witches have been uncovered in a drained pond.

When the waters rise again, it spells doom for the town, and a colossal battle ensues between the mystical forces in the town, the local churches, and the Bureau for Paranormal Research and Defense.
