It sure isn't pretty when a street wise cop is assigned a new partner, a martial artist who lists hit man on his resume. The Kosansui have taken out a contract on the two cops, Griff and Dane. To complicate matters, Dane has fallen in love with the woman who may be the leader of the Yakuza splinter group. Griff meets his fate in the final book of this riveting series. When Griff's wife is captured by the Kosansui, he and Dane track them with a vengeance. Events take a surprising turn when they discover who masterminded the kidnapping.
