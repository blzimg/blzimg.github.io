Painted cover by Neal Adams. Adaption of the first episode of the cartoon. Hoggish Greedly and Rigger are drilling for oil in a protected area, and their drilling wakes up Gaia, the Spirit of the Earth.

<li>Kwame, from Africa, with the power of Earth</li>
<li>Wheeler, from North America, with the power of Fire</li>
<li>Gi, from Asia, with the power of Water </li>
<li>Linka, from the Soviet Union (Eastern Europe), with the power of Wind</li>
<li>Ma-Ti, from South America, with the power of Heart</li>
</ul>
