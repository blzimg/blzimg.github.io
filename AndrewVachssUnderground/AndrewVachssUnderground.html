When there is no longer any reliable source of "news," there is nothing to trust... and "The Terror" descends. 
</p><p>
For decades, The Rulers have been at work, using prisoner/slave labor to construct Underground, believing that all those who flee there will trade their freedom for security. Now, "truth" is what the Rulers say it is, and The Rulers rule all. 
</p><p>
But even within this antiseptically evil world, a revolution is brewing. A new breed of journalists known as "The Book Boys" risk everything to graffiti the truth on Underground's pristine walls.
