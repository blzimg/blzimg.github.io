Don Rosa argues that Captain Flash qualifies as the first modern super-hero because, whereas all the other new hereoes of the warly to mid 50s either had no powers or obtained their powers through mechanical devices. Captian Flash gained super powers through exposure to radiation. Professor Keith Spencer had the ability to give himself super powers simply by clapping. When he claps his hands, this cause a miniature atomic explosion inside his body. He then becomes Captain Flash. He has super strength, invulnerability and super speed.
