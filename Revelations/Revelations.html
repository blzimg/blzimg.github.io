1995 series, not much known, but it is sometimes listed as "Revelations Ashcan". The term "ashcan copy" has been used to describe promotional or low-grade material created to preserve a claim to licensed property rights.

2006 series, from Paul Jenkins and Humberto Ramos, the best-selling creative team behind Marvel's Spectacular Spider-Man, comes a sophisticated murder mystery set in the unlikeliest of places, The Vatican. 
</p><p>
Charlie Northern may be one of the best detectives in Scotland Yard but that doesn't keep him from enjoying a night off curled up with a good book of conspiracy theories and a full pack of cigarettes. That is, until an old friend shows up at his door with the news that a high-ranking Vatican official and probable successor to the Pope has mysteriously died. 
</p><p>
Now, Northern must travel to Rome and seek out the facts in a place legendary for keeping its secrets. There are forces at work in The Holy See that want Northern to fail, forces darker and more ancient than any in his favorite dime-store paperbacks.
