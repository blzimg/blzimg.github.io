Many years ago, in the mystical city of Kun' Lun, young Danny Rand stared at a suit behind glass -- the garb of 'the Immortal Iron Fist' -- and knew that he was destined to wear it. But where did this costume come from? Why did it wait for Danny all those years like a shadow of his future? 
</p><p>
The answer to those questions will stun both him and his readers, as Danny Rand leaps from the pages of his breakout hit in DAREDEVIL to his own series - a history-spanning kung-fu epic that will shatter every perception of what it means to be the Immortal Iron Fist!
