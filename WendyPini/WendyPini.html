Creator of <a href="https://blzim.github.io/kb/Creation/Elfquest/Elfquest.html">ElfQuest</a>,  Wendy Fletcher was born in San Francisco in 1951, and from an early age demonstrated the talents later to come to fruition as a professional illustrator and creator of Elfquest, originally as an independant publication. 
</p><p>
She also formed WARP Graphics. In addition to Elfquest, WARP also published several other comic book series, including Myth Adventures and related titles by Robert Asprin, and Thunder Bunny, created by Martin Greim.
</p><p>
Wendy's youthful interest in fantasy was inspired in part by such luminaries as Shakespeare and Kipling. She took artistic inspiration from Victorian illustrators such as <a href="../ArthurRackham/ArthurRackham.html">Arthur Rackham</a> and Edmund Dulac, designers such as Walt Disney, Doug Wildey, and Ert√©, as well as comic book greats such as Jack Kirby and Japanese manga artist Osamu Tezuka.
</p><p>
Wendy Fletcher and Richard Pini met when Pini read a letter of Fletcher's that had been published in issue #5 of the Silver Surfer comic book. A correspondence began, spanning a period of four years. The two eventually married in 1972, and Wendy embarked upon a career as an illustrator for sci-fi magazines. 
</p><p>
Wendy contributed several covers and illustrations to Galaxy Science Fiction and Galileo magazines in the mid-1970s, before launching Elfquest in 1978. Wendy was also known for dressing up at comic book conventions as Red Sonja. In addition to Elfquest, Wendy Pini also created two graphic novels based on the TV series Beauty and the Beast and has illustrated occasional stories for both Marvel Comics and DC Comics. She wrote an introduction to the first volume of the Gargoyles trade paperback and mentions being a fan of the show.
