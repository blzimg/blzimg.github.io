Michael Choi is a comic book artist and video game concept artist, known for his work on books by DC Comics, Marvel Comics and Top Cow Comics, such as Witchblade, X-23 and X-Force. Choi worked at IBM for three years as an IT consultant before changing careers. Choi penciled a six-issue Marvel entitled X-23: Target X limited series. Michael Choi joined Marvel and penciled Uncanny X-Men from issue #495 to issue #499 with writer Ed Brubaker. In the April 2007 issue of Wizard Magazine (#186) Choi was named number 10 of the "Hot 10 Artists" for his work on X-23: Target X. Said the magazine, "Choi pulls up the rear with his newly popular, vibrant pencils."

In 2010, Choi provided the illustrations in a pictorial featuring comedic actress Olivia Munn in the April/May 2010 issue of Complex magazine, and on its cover. The pictorial featured Munn interacting with illustrated animals in a forest setting, which were drawn by Choi and colored by Sonia Oback. Choi's approach to the visuals were inspired by the music video for the A-ha single "Take On Me". Choi previewed his creator-owned series, Chomperstompers, on Twitter, before its debut at the 2010 San Diego Comic-Con. In 2012, Choi provided the cover to Green Lantern vol. 5 #5, and guest pencilled issue #6. In November 2013, Choi participated in his first gallery showing at Gallery Nucleus in Alhambra, California. In 2015, March 2015, Kotaku named Choi as one of the 20 best X-Men artists over the 50-year history of the comic books.
