Eisner &amp; Iger was a comic book "packager" that produced comics on demand for publishers entering the new medium during the late-1930s and 1940s period fans and historians call the Golden Age of Comic Books. Many of comic books' most significant creators, including Jack Kirby, entered the field through its doors.

The company, formally titled the Eisner and Iger Studio, was also known as Syndicated Features Corporation. Will Eisner, in a 1997 interview, referred to the company as both "Eisner &amp; Iger" and the "Art Syndication Company". It existed from 1936 to 1939 to service the emerging market for American comic books, which had originated as tabloid-sized magazines that reprinted newspaper comic strips, adding color to black-and-white daily comics.

One such seminal comic book, Henle Publications' Wow, What a Magazine! published by John Henle and edited by Jerry Iger. Wow brought Iger together with a 19-year-old Will Eisner who wrote and drew the adventure feature "Scott Dalton", the pirate feature "The Flame", and the secret agent feature "Harry Karry" for Wow.

However it was structured, the firm grew to be one of the most successful and influential of such comics packagers as Funnies, Inc. (which supplied the contents of Marvel Comics No. 1, including the Human Torch, the Sub-Mariner and the Angel) and the quirkily named Harry "A" Chesler's studio.

Eisner &amp; Iger created material as well for Fox Comics, Quality Comics, and others. By 1939, the firm had 15 writers, artists and letterers on staff, according to Eisner: "They were working for me full-time, on salary. I tried to avoid dealing with freelancers on a per-page basis", although future industry Jack Kirby has called his early work in the Eisner &amp; Iger office freelance). Other future luminaries who worked there included Lou Fine, Bob Kane, Wallace Wood, Bob Powell and Jules Feiffer. During this time, Eisner is credited with co-creating characters including Doll Man, and Blackhawk.
</p><p>
After Eisner sold his share of company stock to Iger in late 1939 or early 1940 in order to leave and launch The Spirit, Iger would continue to package comics as the S. M. Iger Studio through 1955.

Jerry Iger is the great-uncle of The Walt Disney Company's CEO Bob Iger. Will Eisner, meanwhile, is not related to Disney's previous CEO Michael Eisner.
