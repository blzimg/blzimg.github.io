The 1992 Marc Bell created Caliber Press "Boof" does not seem to have anything to do with the John Cleary Image version.
</p><p>
Todd McFarlane, creator of Spawn, was the driving force behind Boof. The series premiered in July of 1994 and featured the title character, a short, fat warrior from the planet Smashmouth. The thoroughly obnoxious Boof is discovered by a small, ten-year-old boy named Nick while Nick was playing in the yard. Although he became friends with Nick, the same can’t be said for Nick’s dog Buddy. They took an instant dislike of each other and are constantly at each other’s throats. Boof crash-landed on Earth while trying to return to Smashmouth and now needs a place to hide until he can repair his ship.

This title was scripted by Beau Smith and drawn by John Cleary. Boof can also be seen in the companion title Boof and the Bruise Crew.
