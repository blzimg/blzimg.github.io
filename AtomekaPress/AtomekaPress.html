Atomeka Press is a British publisher of comic books set up in 1988 by Dave Elliott and Garry Leach. Atomeka ceased publishing in 1997, was briefly revived from 2002 to 2005 and revived again in 2013.
</p><p>
Atomeka was established as a company offering creators complete freedom over their material, as well as the opportunity to own all the rights to their creations. Their first title, A1, was an anthology featuring the likes of Ted McKeever, Alan Moore, Glenn Fabry, and Simon Bisley. Seeing who was involved in the project it was natural that A1 contained some stories that were continuations of Warrior strips such as The Bojeffries Saga and Warpsmith, written by Alan Moore with art by Steve Parkhouse and Garry Leach respectively. During its run A1 won several awards, including the 1990 Harvey Award for best anthology.
</p><p>
During the 1990s, Atomeka continued publishing A1, as well as related specials such as A1: Bikini Confidential. They company also published some of Simon Bisley's creator-owned work during this period, in titles such as Monster Massacre and Heavy Metal. In 1992, Elliott solo-edited a four-issue sequel to A1 in colour for Marvel Comics's Epic Comics imprint.
</p><p>
As Tundra UK's publisher, in 1992 Dave Elliott began using the Atomeka imprint to establish its own identity within the larger company; he was also responsible for titles with all the British comic creators. Elliott brought two titles he started at John Brown Publishing, Lazarus Churchyard and White Trash, with him to complete with Tundra UK/Atomeka.
</p><p>
With Tundra UK's demise in 1993, Elliott started Blackball Comics. In 1997, Atomeka ceased publishing, as Elliott and Leach pursued other projects.
