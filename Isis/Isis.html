The Secrets of Isis, originally broadcast as Isis, is an American live-action superhero television series produced by Filmation from 1975 to 1977 for CBS's Saturday morning lineup. The series was renamed The Secrets of Isis in syndication. The program was the first weekly American live-action television series with a female superhero lead character, debuting September 6, 1975, and predating the weekly debuts of both The Bionic Woman (January 14, 1976) and Wonder Woman (April 21, 1976).

In the series, Isis (Joanna Cameron) is the alter ego of Andrea Thomas, a seemingly normal schoolteacher, who transforms into the Egyptian goddess when presented with crises a mere mortal cannot resolve. Episodes of the series featured crossovers featuring Captain Marvel from the companion series, Shazam!. Likewise, Joanna Cameron appeared as Isis on Shazam! in return; and since then DC Comics has adopted the character of Isis into their mainstream continuity for modern comics.

Isis starred Joanna Cameron as Andrea Thomas, a science teacher at Larkspur High School who found an ancient mystical gold amulet, the "Tutmose amulet," on an archeological dig in Egypt. The Isiac amulet, which resembled the headdress of Hathor, had originally belonged to Queen Hatshepsut, an Ancient Egyptian pharaoh. The amulet gave the wearer (specifically, Hatshepsut and her descendants, of which Andrea was one) "the powers of the animals and the elements," which would be bestowed upon such wearer by the goddess Isis whenever it was exposed to the sun and her name invoked. Whenever Isis was needed, Andrea would reveal the Isiac amulet (which she wore as an everyday necklace) and recite an incantation—"Oh mighty Isis"—transforming her into the goddess/super-heroine.
