Picking up where John Carpenter's film "The Thing" left off: MacReady is certain he's going to die. But he doesn't care--as long as he can destroy the frozen remains of the Thing before he freezes to death. That shouldn't be too much of a problem, should it?
</p><p>
MacReady and Childs against an alien life form that could be inside anyone. Thirty-two pages of Antarctic action that ends in terror aboard a nuclear submarine!
</p><p>
Climate of Fear<br>
Written by John Arcudi. Art by Jim Somerville and Robert Jones. Cover by John Higgins.
</p><p>
After his ordeal in Dark Horse's first Thing From Another World series, MacReady awakes to discover that he's been transported to an Argentinian military base far from Antarctica...but so has the Thing!
</p><p>
Nerves are on edge for the residents of the Argentine base at Bahia Thetis, and no wonder: at least one person in the camp is really The Thing! Tension turns to terror as writer John Arcudi (Aliens: Genocide), penciller Jim Somerville (Aliens: Newt's Tale), and inker Robert Jones breathe life into the creepiest, most insidious monster ever to leap from celluloid to the comics page! Painter John Higgins (World Without End) provides this issue's "mind-expanding" cover!
</p><p>
MacReady thought Childs was dead -- until his old friend showed up at the Argentine base with a contingent of American commandos. But is it really Childs, or yet another incarnation of the shape-shifting Thing from another world? And how can MacReady be sure he himself isn't infected?
</p><p>
The conclusion to "Climate of Fear." MacReady discovers that the Thing has been busy building a ship -- and it's up to him to destroy the alien before it can take off to a more populated area. But how much good is a can of gas and a torch against a monster the size of a locomotive?
</p><p>
Eternal Vows<br>
Written by David de Vries. Art by Paul Gulacy and Dan Davis.
</p><p>
Police Sgt. Rowan arrives at Wallace Harbour from mainland New Zealand to investigate a baffling series of murders on isolated Stewart Island, and is sickened by what he finds. What Rowan will soon discover is that The Thing from Another World has finally made a beachhead on the doorstep to our civilized world, seeking out new flesh and ready to wreak the necessary havoc to get it.
</p><p>
Sgt. Rowan finally gets some answers from MacReady about the true nature of The Thing. As more people on Stewart Island turn up dead and mutilated, clues lead to the American ship, the Gettysburg, docked in Wallace Harbour. Meanwhile, Jennifer's own little private hell gets a little bit smaller as she struggles with The Thing -- and her lover, Powell -- for control of her memories and desires. The series is written by David de Vries, who brings the kind of authenticity of dialogue and place only a native New Zealander can to the story.
</p><p>
MacReady, The Thing's first, and worst, nemesis, is going to extremes to keep it from migrating beyond Stewart Island, New Zealand. He couldn't care less about Jennifer's problems in coming to terms with her newly realized status of being deceased... not to mention being an extension of The Thing. But while he's got The Thing coming at him from one direction, he's got the disbelieving Wallace Harbour townsfolk coming at him from the other. That's making it very difficult to do what he really wants to do -- torch the whole dad-gummed town!
</p><p>
The hunt for The Thing from Another World leads MacReady to the Gettysburg, anchored in Wallace Harbour. He's positive The Thing has traded identities with one of the crewmen on board, and isn't about to take any chances: he's ready to torch anyone who stands in his way. The seemingly eternal battle is once more down to MacReady and his otherworldly nemesis -- literally, 'til death do them part. But then of course, if it's The Thing and not MacReady that bites the big one, that doesn't really leave Dark Horse an opening for its next series... does it?
