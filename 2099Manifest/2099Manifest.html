About: 48 pages, can't find anybody that likes this one. Looks like it ends the whole 2099 branch. In 1996, when Marvel, during a cost-cutting exercise, fired the editor Joey Cavalieri, many of the 2099 creators (including Peter David and Warren Ellis) quit the line in protest and sales slumped. This issue killed it.

Story: Captain America was found in suspended animation and, with Miguel O'Hara, assembled various 2099 heroes into a new team of Avengers. The story summarized the years from 2099 to 3099, with humanity transforming the corporate world of 2099 into a utopia and then expanding into space.
