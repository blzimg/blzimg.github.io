Illustrated by Mike McKone and Mark McKenna, written by Len Kaminski, 1 issue in 1998 by Marvel.

Captain America was found in suspended animation and, with Miguel O'Hara, assembled various 2099 heroes into a new team of Avengers. The story summarized the years from 2099 to 3099, with humanity transforming the corporate world of 2099 into a utopia and then expanding into space.

48 pages, can't find anybody that likes this one. Looks like it ends the whole 2099 branch. In 1996, when Marvel, during a cost-cutting exercise, fired the editor Joey Cavalieri, many of the 2099 creators (including Peter David and Warren Ellis) quit the line in protest and sales slumped. This issue killed it.
