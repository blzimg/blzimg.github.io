For years fans have demanded to see more of Jill Thompson's Little Endless, the diminutive versions of the characters from Neil Gaiman's award-winning series THE SANDMAN. Now those dreams are fulfilled. 
</p><p>
The story begins once upon a time when Little Delirium was lost. Her protector and favorite puppy Barnabas searched the waking world for his tiny princess to no avail. Now, Barnabas must travel to the strange and unlikely realms of each of the Endless to see if Delirium's siblings have seen their missing sister. Cameos by the Sandman, Desire and the other members of the Endless family make this a must-have for any Sandman enthusiast.
