Marvel Knights was an imprint of Marvel Comics that contained material taking place just outside the Marvel Universe (Earth-616). The imprint originated in 1998 when Marvel outsourced four titles (Black Panther, The Punisher, Daredevil, and The Inhumans) to Joe Quesada and Jimmy Palmiotti's company Event Comics. Event hired the creative teams for the Knights line while Marvel published them. Marvel Knights became dormant after 2013.

The Marvel Knights team was a name given to Daredevil's unnamed superhero team. Besides Daredevil, the line-up consisted of Black Widow, Dagger, Moon Knight, Shang-Chi and Luke Cage. The Marvel Knights were initially formed to capture the Punisher.
