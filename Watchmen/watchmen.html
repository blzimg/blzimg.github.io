Watchmen was created by a British collaboration consisting of writer <a href="../AlanMoore/AlanMoore.html">Alan Moore</a>, artist <a href="../DaveGibbons/DaveGibbons.html">Dave Gibbons</a>, and colorist John Higgins. Watchmen originated from a story proposal Moore submitted to DC featuring superhero characters that the company had acquired from Charlton Comics. As Moore's proposed story would have left many of the characters unusable for future stories, managing editor Dick Giordano convinced Moore to create original characters instead.
</p><p>
Moore used the story as a means to reflect contemporary anxieties and to deconstruct and parody the superhero concept. Watchmen depicts an alternate history where superheroes emerged in the 1940s and 1960s and their presence changed history so that the United States won the Vietnam War and the Watergate scandal was never exposed, so Nixon is still president as of October 1985.
</p><p>
The existence of Doctor Manhattan has given the U.S. a strategic advantage over the Soviet Union, which has increased tensions edging toward World War III leading to the passage of legislation (the Keene Act) in 1977 to outlaw them. While most former superheroes go into retirement or work for the government, Doctor Manhattan and The Comedian operate as government-sanctioned agents. Rorschach, continues to operate outside the law.
</p><p>
The story focuses on the personal development and moral struggles of the protagonists as an investigation into the murder of a government-sponsored superhero pulls them out of retirement.
