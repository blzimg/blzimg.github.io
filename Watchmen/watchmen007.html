Story: A Brother to Dragons
<p>
Dan finds Laurie touring his basement hideout. He explains his collection of crime fighting gadgets and mementos, often downplaying them. Laurie, who is captivated by these forgotten objects, tries to cheer Dan up by praising him for his ingenuity.
</p><p>
Later in Dan’s apartment, Dan and Laurie are watching television when passion sparks between them. Laurie initiates making love, but Dan just can’t seem to get going.
</p><p>
They fall asleep and Dan, awakened by a nightmare, heads naked into his basement hideout to sulk. Laurie discovers him and while she is trying to console him, they decide to suit up in their old costumes and take Dan’s airship “Archie” out for spin to help clear Dan’s head.
</p><p>
While they’re cruising over New York City, they notice that a nearby tenement is on fire. After leading the trapped residents to safety, Dan’s passion and confidence is reborn and the pair consummate their relationship inside the airship. Afterwards, Dan, feeling a new sense of obligation to his old costumed partners, decides that they have to break Rorschach out of prison.
