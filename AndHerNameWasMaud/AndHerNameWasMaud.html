And Her Name Was Maud was a comic strip by <a href="../FrederickBurrOpper/FrederickBurrOpper.html">Frederick Burr Opper</a>. It first appeared in the Hearst newspapers on July 24, 1904, by <a href="../CupplesLeon/CupplesLeon.html">Cupples &amp; Leon</a>. After work as a magazine cartoonist, Opper was hired by Hearst in 1899 to draw comic strips for the New York Journal, launching Happy Hooligan, Alphonse and Gaston and And Her Name Was Maud.

Maud was a revenge-seeking mule belonging to farmer Si Slocum and his wife Mirandy. Most of the action was a build-up to Maud kicking someone into the air. Si was the most frequent victim.

As was common in the early years of comic strips, the title under which Maud the Mule appeared might change from week to week. The character sometimes had crossover appearances in Opper's other strips, Happy Hooligan and Alphonse and Gaston. Maud was phased out in the 1910s, but reappeared from 1926 to the last appearance on October 14, 1932.
