Osamu Tezuka was born in the town of Takarazuka in Osaka, Japan on 3 November 1928 and sadly passed away on 9 February 1989. He is often hailed the Walt Disney of Japan. His most notable character, <a href="../AstroBoy/AstroBoy.html">Astro Boy</a>, first appeared in 1951 as 'Captain Astro'. Between 1952 and 1968, Astro Boy appeared regularly in the Shonen manga, published by Kobunsha. The character is still very much loved in Japan: Astro Boy even became an honorary citizen of a town in Saitama where Tezuka had a studio.

This Japanese legend has a style all of his own and counted Disney and Kubrick amongst his fervent fans. Dubbed 'the father of anime' and 'the god of Manga', he was light years ahead of the competition. He was the inventor of the 'big eyes' style of Japanese animation as well as Kimba The White Lion, a clear influence on The Lion King. His work deftly flits across genres, elements of sci-fi, mysticism, horror and history. You name it, Tezuka did it first and best.

Astro Boy was the first animated series to appear on Japanese television, first appearing on Fuji Television in 1963. At his time of death, Osamu Tezuka had drawn over 50,000 pages of manga and had created over 60 animations. Tezuka published the magazine Com as a forum for young writers. He created the classic series The Phoenix for the magazine.
