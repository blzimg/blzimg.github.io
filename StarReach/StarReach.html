Star Reach (also spelled Star*Reach) was an American science fiction and fantasy comics anthology published from 1974 to 1979 by Mike Friedrich.
</p><p>
One of the first American mainstream independent comic books, Star*Reach bridged the gap between the countercultural underground comics and traditional Marvel/DC Comics fare, providing mature genre stories for an adult audience. The fan press of the time referred to this and the comics magazine Heavy Metal as "ground-level publications". 
</p><p>
Along with such other examples as Flo Steinberg's Big Apple Comix, published in 1975, and Harvey Pekar's naturalistic Everyman series American Splendor, first published in 1976, Star*Reach was a forerunner of the late 1970s rise of the modern graphic novel, and of the 1980s' independent comics.
</p><p>
Eighteen issues were released between 1974 and 1979. Contributors included such Marvel and DC writers and artists as Howard Chaykin, Jim Starlin, and Barry Windsor-Smith. It also included prose short stories by such authors as Roger Zelazny, who wrote the 13-page "The Doors of His Face, The Lamps of His Mouth", with illustrations by Gray Morrow, in issue #12 (March 1978).
</p><p>
Friedrich's company grew into a small publishing house in Hayward, California, also called Star*Reach, that published the comic book series Quack; Imagine; and Lee Marrs' Pudge, Girl Blimp, along with a number of one-shot comics. The company ceased publishing in 1979. Eclipse Comics repackaged some of the original Star*Reach and Imagine material as Star*Reach Classics in 1984.

The book opens with an editorial by Friedrich explaining why Star*Reach has come about, then jumps right into a terrific story written and drawn by Jim Starlin, entitled; “The Birth Of Death”.  It’s eight pages long and has a bit of a twist ending for those of you that enjoy that type of story.  It features God, the angel Lucifer, as well as, mankind, plus features the “origin” of Death!
</p><p>
Next up we get the story entitled; “Death Building” also written and drawn by Jim Starlin. It’s seven pages long and also features the character, Death.  In fact Jim Starlin plays a cameo part in the story.
</p><p>
The next two strips/stories are written and drawn by Steve Skeates.  They are each two pages long and frankly, it’s “not my cup of tea”.  Obviously I’m not a fan of Skeates’ art style.  The first is called “Fish Myths” and the second; “Suburban Fish”, and both are about fish!
</p><p>
Next up is a nice story entitled; “A Tale Of Sword &amp;Sorcery” written by Ed Hicks and drawn by Walt Simonson.  It runs twelve pages and it’s worth the read, at least in my opinion.  The last eleven pages even offer a “flip book” like half inch strip running at the bottom of the page, and I do mean running!
</p><p>
This brings us to the cover featured story.  It’s simply entitled; “Cody Starbuck” and it’s written and drawn by Howard Chaykin and introduces the comic reading world to the title character.  The story runs sixteen pages and is the longest story in the comic.  This first Starbuck story introduces the reader to a galaxy where two great empires had toppled due to a great war.  All that now remains are groups of people was fall into four categories, traders, missionaries, mime troupes and pirates. Cody Starbuck is one of the last category!
</p><p>
The story opens with action as Starbuck is fighting to free a woman who has been kidnapped and held for ransom.  It seems that his services have been hired by a wealthy individual to free his fiancee.  The fact that the individual is paying Starbuck ore than the cost of the ransom is ironic, but he’s proving a point.  Starbuck is successful and returns the girl to Lord Gideon. While there he encounters the man, William Trachmann, who was responsible for costing Starbuck his commission and thus driving him into a life of piracy.
