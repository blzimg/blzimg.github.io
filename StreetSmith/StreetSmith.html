Street &amp; Smith or Street &amp; Smith Publications, Inc. was a New York City publisher specializing in inexpensive paperbacks and magazines referred to as dime novels and pulp fiction. They also published comic books and sporting yearbooks. Among their many titles was the science fiction pulp magazine Astounding Stories, acquired from Clayton Magazines in 1933, and retained until 1961. Street &amp; Smith was founded in 1855, and was bought out in 1959. The Street &amp; Smith headquarters was at 79 Seventh Avenue in Manhattan; it was designed by Henry F. Kilburn.

Street &amp; Smith stopped publishing all their pulps and comics in 1949, selling off several of their titles to Popular Publications. Sales had declined with the advent of television. Street &amp; Smith continued to publish Astounding Science Fiction well into the late 1950s. Condé Nast Publications, a subsidiary of the Newhouse family's Advance Publications, bought the company for more than $3.5 million in 1959. The company's name continued to be used on the sports pre-season preview magazines until 2007 when Advance division American City Business Journals acquired the Sporting News, originally The Sporting News, and merged Street &amp; Smith's annuals into TSN's annuals. However, in 2017, American City Business Journals revived the Street &amp; Smith name for its sports annuals.

The Street &amp; Smith name survives as the named publisher of Sports Business Journal, a Condé Nast periodical.
