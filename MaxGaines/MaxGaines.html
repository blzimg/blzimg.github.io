Maxwell Charles Gaines (1894 â€“ 1947) was a pioneering figure in the creation of the modern comic book. Born Maxwell Ginzberg, he was also known as Max Gaines, M. C. Gaines and Charlie Gaines. 
</p><p>
In 1933, Gaines devised the first four-color, saddle-stitched newsprint pamphlet, a precursor to the color-comics format that became the standard for the American comic book industry. 
</p><p>
He was co-publisher of All-American Publications, a seminal comic-book company that introduced such enduring fictional characters as Green Lantern, Wonder Woman and Hawkman. He went on to found Educational Comics, producing the series Picture Stories from the Bible. He authored one of the earliest essays on comic books, a 1942 pamphlet titled Narrative Illustration, The Story of the Comics.
</p><p>
After Gaines' death in 1947, Educational Comics was taken over by his son <a href="../BillGaines/BillGaines.html">Bill Gaines</a>, who transformed the company (now known as EC Comics) into a pioneer of horror, science fiction and satirical comics.
</p><p>
In 1985, Max Gaines was posthumously named as one of the honorees by DC Comics in the company's 50th anniversary publication "Fifty Who Made DC Great" in 1985.
