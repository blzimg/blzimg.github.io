There is perhaps no book out this year that does a more fantastic job of humanizing and breathing new life into its central character than Saladin Ahmed and Christian James Ward’s Black Bolt. Though the Inhuman king has been a fixture of Marvel’s comics for decades, Black Bolt strips the monarch of his friends, family, power, and station in order to turn him into the most three-dimensional, relatable version of himself he’s been in recent memory. In Black Bolt, Blackagar Boltagon becomes a man—not in the sense that he is no longer Inhuman, but rather that we see him walking and living amongst the people in a way that grounds him.

As Black Bolt and his companions try to find their way out of a horrifying space prison, the king’s personality rises to the fore and we see that he’s so much more than the silent, stoic person he’s most often depicted as. He’s compassionate and caring, but also vulnerable and haunted by the mistakes of his past. None of these things are exactly shocking—Black Bolt’s a rather regular guy, all things considered—but these are parts of him that, typically, are quite literally muted.

The king of the Inhumans has been imprisoned! But where? Why has he been jailed? And who could be powerful enough to hold the uncanny Black Bolt? The answers will shock you - and Blackagar Boltagon as well! For if he is to learn the truth, he must first win a fight to the death against a fellow inmate: the Absorbing Man! As a prison revolt begins, Death's Head enters the fray - but is he there to help, or to hunt? And who - or what - is the warden of this strange place? Whatever it is, the Jailer knows only penance and fear. And soon, so will the Silent King!
