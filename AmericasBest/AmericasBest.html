America's Best Comics (ABC) is a comic book publishing brand. It was set up by Alan Moore in 1999 as an imprint of WildStorm, an idea proposed to Moore by WildStorm founder Jim Lee when it was still under Image Comics, but is now under DC.
</p><p>
<a href="../AmericasBestComics/AmericasBestComics.html">America's Best Comics</a> was a prominent Standard/Better/Nedor title during the 1940s Golden Age of comic books, starring such heroes as the Black Terror and the Fighting Yank. Those characters were integrated into the Moore version under the ABC imprint.

Using this, Moore wrote the series <a href="../LeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen/LeagueOfExtraordinaryGentlemen.html">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a>, a strip which merged several famous Victorian era fiction characters into one world.
</p><p>
Also, Tom Strong, an homage to pulp fiction heroes such as Tarzan and Doc Savage. Top 10, a police procedural set in a police precinct in a city where everyone has superpowers, and <a href="../Promethea/Promethea.html">Promethea</a>, one of Moore's most personal pieces which detailed his view on magic.
