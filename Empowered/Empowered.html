Series: 10 issues 2007<br>
Publisher: Dark Horse<br>
<p>
Story and Art by Adam Warren. Even as costumed crime fighter Empowered fights a desperate battle against a functionally invulnerable, grave-robbing super villain inside a secret underground mausoleum for fallen superheroes, back at Emp's apartment, the alien demonlord imprisoned upon her coffee table spins a tempestuous tell-all tale of the often-struggling heroine's deepest secrets.
</p><p>
The scruple-free storyteller soon reveals how all of Empowered's many frustrations at work, at home, and even in the bedroom can be conveyed strictly through the vocabulary of her extraordinarily expressive exhalations, thus making her, 'The wench with a Million Sighs!'
