In the past, the Lord of the Apes has risked his life to save many people, some of whom he called friend and others for whom he had no name. Now, it is Jane who needs saving. She is dying, the result of a mysterious virus. And with no one to battle, no savage creatures to fend off, for the first time in his life, Tarzan feels helpless.
