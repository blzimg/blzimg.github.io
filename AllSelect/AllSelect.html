The Vulture and his Batmen capture various important figures of the war effort until Cap and Bucky are taken to their aerie and overpower the Vulture. With their leader defeated, and the serum that gives them flight collected by Cap, the Batmen and Vulture will die within a few hours. Cap and Bucky inject the hostages with the serum, along with themselves, and they fly down from the aerie.
