Story:
#1 Sex n Death: Got a problem that needs fixing? Permanent fixing? Call Mike Fallon, a.k.a. Accident Man. He can arrange a discreet, unsuspicious and entirely unavoidable accident for the victim of your choice, if you can afford his fee, of course. In this issue, Fallon meets the beautiful Mirror Morgan, and gets himself embroiled in an intrigue that involves sex, shopping, and several suspicious fatalities.
</p><p>
#2 His name's Fallon, Mike Fallon, a ladies' man, a hit man, but more to the point, an Accident Man, who can fix your problems discreetly and permanently. Now he's out to make an impression on the mafia and passes his test with flying colors, most of it blood red. But there's more to this set-up than meets the eye.
<p><p>
#3 Mike Fallon faces his ultimate challenge as he infiltrates a Mafia cell, where his mission is to eliminate the Godfather. And of course, he's got to make it look like an accident. If he can survive that, then he's got to draw on all his assassin's skills to deal with the beautiful but deadly Stiletto. An Accident Man's work is never done.
