Everything goes wrong. It sounded good on paper: Sophie is back on Earth and back as Promethea. All is right in the world, all are happy...except, perhaps, for the person who has taken her place. It's a battle of best friends who both happen to be Prometheas. Also, new information is revealed about several Prometheas from the past.
