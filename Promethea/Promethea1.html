KINGDOM COME!<br>
In the streets of a modern-day New York incredibly different from the one we know, college student Sophie Bangs is researching a centuries-old myth of a warrior-woman called Promethea. But the truth about Promethea is both stranger than the fiction and a fiction itself, and if Sophie can't figure it out in time, she'll be killed by one of Promethea's enemies. But if she does figure it out, Sophie will become the ultimate embodiment of the Promethea legend.
