What is the Temple? What are the secrets of the sinister organization that has plagued Promethea during her many incarnations? Following last issue's apocalyptic assault by the demons of Benny Solomon, our heroine decides to race the trouble back to its source and burn out the cult at its roots, once and for all...although her enemy may not turn out to be quite as she'd imagined. Also: a mystery hangs over the fate of Sophie's now-deceased predecessor, Barbara; and Sophie finds herself making a most unusual pact with someone named Faust.
