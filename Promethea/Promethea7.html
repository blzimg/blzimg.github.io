A special issue featuring a computer-collage sequence illustrated by Jose Villarubia (VEILS). Strange and sulphurous clouds continue to gather over the life of Sophie Bangs while she struggles to understand the nature of the deal that has transformed her into a two-thousand-year- old living legend. Benny Solomon and his Mephistophelean version of Murder, Inc. turn up in New York looking for the latest incarnation of Promethea, while Sophie continues her trek across the Immmateria to discover her unearthly birthright. This time she's accompanied by '40s comic-book creator William Woolcott, the only male ever to serve as a vessel of the half-real heroine.
