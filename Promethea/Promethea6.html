We continue to unravel the golden thread of our sensuous sentient story's previous incarnations with an enchanted glance at Grace Brannagh, the 1920's version who ruled in pulp-fantasy splendor as "A Warrior Queen of Hy Brasil." Learn more about the mythical lost continent and about Promethea's destiny and origins as she confronts the Pseudonymous Psorcery of the malevolent Marto Neptura, the writer that never was. And as if that weren't gripping enough, in the present, Sophie Bangs must fend off a veritable tidal wave of demons as one-man magical Murder Inc. Benny Solomon takes his ruinous revenge!
