<p>
Elric, an exiled king overthrown by his sorcerous cousin, seeks revenge. He backs his own wizardry and enchanted weaponry with navies from nearby nations. They are promised all the plunder their boats can carry, as long as nothing is left of the city but scorched earth, and the battle is on. Elric leads a fleet to the fabled city of Imrryr to rescue his love Cymoril and take revenge against his cousin Yyrkoon who has usurped his throne.
