Tim Lane (<a href="http://www.timlane.co.uk">Tim Lane Studio</a>) was born in Cheltenham and is now based in Bristol. He graduated from Falmouth College of Arts in 2004 with a first class (BA Hons) degree in Illustration.
</p><p>
Since then he has been concentrating on fine art painting and drawing, which was for him a natural progression from his degree, but which provides a far greater creative freedom enjoyed in terms of style and subject matter. The degree which focused mainly on book illustration helped to give structure to his love for working directly from his imagination and gives his art its narrative quality. It also encouraged a passion for drawing, which is at the core of all his work.
</p><p>
Tim has sold and exhibited work in various galleries in and around Bristol and has won awards for his painting including the 'Bristol Visual Arts Consortium Award' and the 'People's Prize' Bristol Art Show 2007 at Centrespace Gallery.
