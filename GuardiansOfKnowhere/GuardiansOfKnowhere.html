A single moon orbits Battleworld. But no, that's no moon. It's a space station. It's Knowhere. The head of a dead Celestial, somehow saved in the universal collapse, a colony brimming with convicts and criminals. The Galaxy may be gone, but that doesn't mean there aren't places that still need heroes. Places that need champions. That need GUARDIANS.
