"If Atlantis Should Fall!" Part 2 of 2. Avengers-Defenders crossover. Script by Steve Englehart. Pencils by Sal Buscema. Inks by Frank McLaughlin. Cover by Sal Buscema. With Hawkeye, Valkyrie, and the Sub-Mariner as their mind-slaves, the Red Ghost and Attuma begin their quest to conquer Atlantis! The two super-villains' assault on the underwater citadel is progressing as planned until Doctor Strange and the Silver Surfer get wind of the attack! The key to victory is knocking out the Red Ghost! But how can the Master of the Mystic Arts and the cosmic sky-rider do that? Simple, just block all the cosmic rays from outer space from entering the Earth's atmosphere! Wow, it's a good thing these two defenders are among the most powerful heroes on the planet!
