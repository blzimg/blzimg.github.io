Story continues from Avengers 116. The one-on-one battles for the Evil Eye continue! And the next battleground is Monterrey, Mexico! Iron Man checks in at the local university and finds the professor who is safekeeping the Evil Eye. But before Shell-Head can secure the eye, it's stolen by a defender! Which one? Why it's the Avengers' former ace archer, Hawkeye! And just like old times Hawkeye and Iron Man throw down in the streets of Monterrey! This should be an easy victory for the golden avenger, but the bow-slinger may have a trick or two in store for his former teammate!

Next Chapter: "Dr. Strange vs. the Black Panther and Mantis!" The next piece of the Evil Eye rests in the heartland of America! Could one of the battles to save the world take place in an Indiana cornfield? Doctor Strange arrives in the Midwest first and locates the Evil Eye. The Sorcerer Supreme hopes to make a quick getaway; however, he can't escape the sharp detection skills of T'Challa and Mantis! So the two avengers have found the Master of the Mystic Arts, but now can they beat him in pitched battle? Story continues in Avengers 117.
