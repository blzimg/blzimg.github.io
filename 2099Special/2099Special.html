This 48-page magazine is a companion piece to Marvel’s recent revamping of its 2099 line, in which Doom has taken over the U.S. and instituted an “autocratic democracy” with himself as a one-man executive branch.
</p><p>
Included are interviews with writers Warren Ellis (Doom 2099), Pat Mills and Tony Skinner (Punisher 2099, Ravage 2099), and John Moore (X-Men 2099); a look at the work of Greg and Tim Hildebrandt (who also provided the cover); sketches of designs by Kevin O’Neill (Marshall Law, Metalzoic) for new SHIELD and Punishment Police uniforms; a first look at Toy Biz’s new line of X-Men 2099 action figures; an essay on the phenomenon of cyberspace and the 2099 writers’ difficulty in keeping pace with current technological advances; and Doom’s "Code of Citizen Conduct of the United States," which can be summed up as, "Do as President Doom says, or else."
