It's the comics clash of the new millennium as Britain's award-winning sci-fi anthology 2000 AD teams up with Dark Horse Comics to bring you a battle of epic proportions! The tenacious Judge Dredd, upholding the law in Mega-City One, has faced everything from mutants to supernatural possessions...but can he and a group of judges fend off an infestation of the deadly, acid-drooling Aliens?

Facing their most dangerous enemies yet, it's lawmen versus nature's best killing machines in a bloody battle to keep the vast metropolis of the future from becoming a breeding ground for the vicious creatures. Judge Dredd Vs. Aliens: Incubus brings the carnage, horror, and chest-bursters to the universe of Britain's toughest comics character.
