What would you do if you knew you were a ticking time bomb? If you knew that your continued existence meant limitless death and destruction? What would you do if at any moment you could transform into the rampaging monster known as the Hulk? 
</p><p>
You see, nerdy scientist Bruce Banner has a big problem. When he loses his cool, the 98-lb. weakling transforms into a 1,000-lb., green-skinned engine of devastation! Relentlessly tormented by his monstrous "id," and vigilantly pursued by an elite military unit headed by the enigmatic Doc Samson, Banner has no where to hide ? and that's when the real trouble starts.
</p><p>
Having located the green-skinned monstrosity in the New Mexico desert, Doc Sampson prepares his troops for a High Noon showdown. With a 1,000 Blackhawk helicopters at his disposal, the mysterious government agent has a formidable arsenal, but he's brought along a secret weapon just to be safe.
</p><p>
Doc Samson's got Bruce Banner and his monstrous alter ego just where he wants him. With the Hulk reeling from his secret weapon, Samson prepares for the knockout punch.
