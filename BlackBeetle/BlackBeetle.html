Black Beetle's investigation of two local mob bosses is interrupted when a mysterious explosion murders them and a pub full of gangsters-taking out most of Colt City's organized crime in one fell swoop. Who could pull off such a coup, and what danger might that murderous bomber do to Colt City and Black Beetle?
