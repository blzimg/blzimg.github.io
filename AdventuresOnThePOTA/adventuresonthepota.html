Movie adaptation of Planet of the Apes issues #1-6, then the movie sequal Beneath the Planet of the Apes issues #7-11.
</p><p>
Planet of the Apes: Astronauts Taylor, Landon and Dodge are in deep hibernation when their spaceship crashes in a lake on an unknown planet after a long near-light speed voyage, during which, due to time dilation, the crew ages only 18 months.
</p><p>
Although the planet appears desolate at first, the surviving crew members stumble upon a society in which apes have evolved into creatures with human-like intelligence and speech. The apes have assumed the role of the dominant species and humans are mute creatures wearing animal skins.
</p><p>
The Apes are hostile towards humans, kill the other Astronauts, wound and hold Taylor captive for study. Taylor learns of a place called the Forbidden Zone where he can learn about the human civilization.
</p><p>
Taylor gets free, enters the Forbidden Zone and discovers the remains of the Statue of Liberty, revealing that this alien planet is actually Earth long after a nuclear war. Taylor falls to his knees in despair and anger and condemns humanity for destroying the world.
</li>
<li>Beneath the Planet of the Apes: Another spacecraft crashes on the planet ruled by apes, carrying astronaut Brent who searches for Taylor and discovers an underground city inhabited by mutated humans with psychic powers who worship an ancient nuclear bomb.
</p><p>
An ape follows Brent to the city, and returns with an Ape army to conquer it. The telepaths attempt to repel the apes by projecting illusions of fire and other horrors. Dr. Zaius sees through the illusions, however, and leads the ape army to the ruined city. With the apes closing in, the telepaths plan to detonate their "Divine Bomb" as a last resort. 
</p><p>
They hold a religious ceremony, at the height of which they remove their masks to reveal that they are in fact still-intelligent humans who are descended from survivors of the nuclear wars. The nuclear fallout has mutated them by removing layers of their skin, but greatly increased their psychic abilities.
</p><p>
Ape army finally arrives, kick ass, then in his last moment Taylor brings his hand down on the activation switch, triggering the bomb.
