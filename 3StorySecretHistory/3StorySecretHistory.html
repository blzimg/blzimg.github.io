<h2>3 Story Secret History of Giant Man</h2>
<img src="3StorySecretHistory.jpg"><br>
Series: Graphic Novel<br>
Writer: Matt Kindt<br>
Illustrator: Matt Kindt <br>
Publisher: 2009 by Dark Horse<br>
<p>
Story: The title of the book not only refers to the main character’s size, he’s a giant, after all, but the fact that Kindt tells three different stories about the main character from the point of view of three important women in his life. The main character is named Craig Pressgang (the last name is never explained, although I suppose the way Craig finds his employment is somewhat shady), and throughout the book, he never stops growing. 
</p><p>The first story is told by his mother, whose husband is killed in World War II and is left to raise Craig alone. The second story is told by his wife, Jo, who meets him in college and stays with him as he continues to grow, becomes a worldwide celebrity, and is recruited by the CIA. The third story is told by his daughter, Iris, who is searching for him after he disappears into the wild.
