Flaming Carrot Comics is a comic book series by cartoonist Bob Burden. The title character first appeared in Visions #1, a magazine published by the Atlanta Fantasy Fair in 1979. Flaming Carrot can be seen as a parody of various aspects of the superhero genre (though his origin story is much the same as that of Don Quixote). Burden refers to the character as "the World's first surrealist superhero!"

He has guest-starred and made cameos in comics published by Kilian Barracks, Aardvark-Vanaheim, Fantagraphics, Mirage Studios, Atomeka Press, and others.
