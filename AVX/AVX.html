Avengers vs. X-Men (AVX) is a 2012 crossover event consisting of an eponymous limited series and numerous tie-in books. Despite receiving poor reviews from critics, Avengers vs. X-Men was a commercial success that topped the comic-book sales charts from April to October 2012. The repercussions of the storyline resulted in the new status quos of the Marvel Universe presented in the company's Marvel NOW! relaunch initiative.

The series focuses on the return of the Phoenix Force, the cosmic entity of death and rebirth, as it looks for its new host, believed to be the teenage mutant Hope Summers, who will possess all of its power. Cyclops and the other X-Men want to protect her and prepare her as if she's to be the mutant savior, while Captain America and the Avengers want her handed over to them so they can figure out what to do with her and keep the world safe from a potentially deadly fate.
