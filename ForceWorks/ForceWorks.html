Following the breakup of the West Coast Avengers, Tony Stark decides to form his own team in Southern California and recruits his former teammates to fill the ranks. Rogue Kree agents seek vengeance on Wonder Man and the Vision as a result of Operation Galactic Storm. When the Scarlet Witch and Wonder Man bump into the Vision and Black Widow at their former west coast compound, the Kree terrorists attack en masse.

The U.S. Agent and Shell-head lead the charge at Palos Verdes, while Wonder Man soars into the stratosphere to knock out the Kree's ion cannon. Something goes horribly wrong in outer space, and the new team cannot celebrate their victory in California, even less so when the Scatter appear! Who are these bizarre aliens?
