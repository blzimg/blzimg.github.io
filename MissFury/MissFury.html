The first Black Fury debuted on April 6, 1941, as a Sunday comic strip distributed by the Bell Syndicate, and created by artist Tarpé Mills  the pseudonym of comic book creator June Mills, one of the first major female comics artists. Originally called the Black Fury within the story itself though not as the strip's title, she eventually became known as Miss Fury. Her alter ego was wealthy socialite Marla Drake.

Miss Fury had no innate superpowers, but gained increased strength and speed when she donned a special skintight catsuit when fighting crime. Drake's alter-ego combatted several regular villains,including mad scientist Diman Saraf and Nazi agents Erica Von Kampf and General Bruno. Drake was also involved in a love triangle with her former fiancé, Gary Hale, and Detective Dan Carey.
</p><p>
Although Miss Fury was popular, the revealing outfits worn by its female characters provoked some controversy at the time. When Marla Drake was drawn wearing a bikini in 1947, 37 newspapers dropped the strip in response. The Miss Fury strip ran until 1952. Marvel Comics (then known as Timely Comics) reprinted her Sunday strips in comic book form from 1942 to 1946.

In 1979 Archival Press reissued her early adventures in graphic novel format, with new covers by Mills.

In 2011, IDW's "Library of American Comics" put out a collection of strips covering 1944-49. IDW published another volume containing the 1941-1944 Miss Fury strips in 2013.
