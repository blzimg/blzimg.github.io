Alphonse and Gaston was an American comic strip by <a href="../FrederickBurrOpper/FrederickBurrOpper.html">Frederick Burr Opper</a>, featuring a bumbling pair of Frenchmen with a penchant for politeness. They first appeared in William Randolph Hearst's newspaper, the New York Journal on September 22, 1901, in a strip titled: Alphonse a la Carte and His Friend Gaston de Table d'Hote. The strip was later distributed by <a href="../KingFeatures/KingFeatures.html">King Features Syndicate</a> with collections published by <a href="../CupplesLeon/CupplesLeon.html">Cupples &amp; Leon</a>.

Their "After you, Alphonse.", "No, you first, my dear Gaston!" routine entertained readers for more than a decade. Alphonse was short and grotesque; Gaston was tall and grotesque. The strip's premise was that both were extremely polite, constantly bowing and deferring to each other. Neither could ever do anything or go anywhere because each insisted on letting the other precede him.

Though never a daily or even weekly feature, Alphonse and Gaston appeared on Sundays for several years. In addition to Hearst collections and licensed products, it was adapted into a stage play and several comedy shorts.
