In March of 2016, Eleanor Davis decided to ride her bicycle from her parents’ house in Arizona to Athens, Georgia, where she lives. Here and there, she drew things she saw and put them on Instagram. Followers received little dispatches as she made her way from Southwest to Southeast. Sometimes she was discouraged. Other times she seemed overcome at the beauty of the world or the kindness of strangers.

The story unfolds slowly, without a classical narrative structure or predictable spikes of drama, but it is fascinating. You &amp; a Bike &amp; a Road collects those drawings and captures the journey, while compressing the time that it took. It’s easily one of the year’s best books. The sense of immediacy and unfiltered emotion, its most notable features, are rare and difficult to do well.
