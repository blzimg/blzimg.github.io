The Shadow debuted on July 31, 1930, as the mysterious narrator of the radio program Detective Story Hour, which was developed to boost sales of Street &amp; Smith's monthly pulp Detective Story Magazine.
</p><p>
One of the most famous adventure heroes of the 20th century United States, the Shadow has been featured on the radio, in a long-running pulp magazine series, in American comic books, comic strips, television, serials, video games, and at least five films. The radio drama included episodes voiced by Orson Welles.
</p><p>
The Shadow was developed into a distinctive literary character, later to become a pop culture icon, by writer Walter B. Gibson in 1931 and was characterized as having "the power to cloud men's minds so they cannot see him". The character has been cited as a major influence on the subsequent evolution of comic book superheroes, particularly Batman.
</p><p>
The Shadow is also a 1994 American superhero film from Universal Pictures, produced by Martin Bregman, Willi Bear, and Michael Scott Bregman, directed by Russell Mulcahy, that stars Alec Baldwin. The film co-stars John Lone, Penelope Ann Miller, Ian McKellen, Jonathan Winters, Peter Boyle, and Tim Curry. It is based on the pulp fiction character of the same name created in 1931 by Walter B. Gibson.
</p><p>
This movie pits the hero against his arch enemy, Shiwan Khan, who plans to take over the world by holding a city ransom using an atomic bomb. Using his powers of invisibility and "The power to cloud men's minds", the Shadow comes blazing to the city's rescue with explosive results.
</p><p>
The Shadow was brought back with 12 issues from 1973 - 1975 by DC and 6 issues in 2017 by Dynamite with covers by <a href="../MichaelKaluta/MichaelKaluta.html">Michael Kaluta</a>
