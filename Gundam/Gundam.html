Gundam, also known as the Gundam Series, is a science fiction media franchise created by Sunrise that features giant robots (mecha) with mobile suits bearing the name Gundam. It began on April 7, 1979 as Mobile Suit Gundam, a TV series that defined the real robot or "mecha" anime genre by featuring giant robots in a militaristic setting. The popularity of the series and its merchandise spawned a franchise that includes television series, OVAs, films, manga, novels and video games.

This series follows similar Japanese hits like Gigantor (1956), Ultraman (1966), Johnny Sokko and His Flying Robot (1967), Science Ninja Team Gatchaman or Battle of the Planets (1972), Shogun Warriors (1978). It precedes hits such as Macross (1982), Voltron (1984), Transformers (1984), and Robotech (1985).

In 2014 the Gundam franchise generated billions, most of which was retail sales of toys and hobby items. Gunpla (plastic Gundam models) make up 90 percent of the Japanese character plastic-model market. Academics in Japan have viewed the series as inspiration. In 2008, the virtual Gundam Academy was planned as the first academic institution based on an animated TV series.
