Olivier Coipel is a French comic book artist, known for his work on books such as House of M, Legion of Super-Heroes and Thor. Olivier Coipiel started as a movie animator, working as an assistant on Balto (film) and then The Prince of Egypt, then as a full animator at The Road to El Dorado.
</p><p>
Coipel came to prominence and significant controversy as the artist of the American DC Comics book Legion of Super-Heroes during the tenure of writers Dan Abnett and Andy Lanning., beginning with the "Legion of the Damned" story arc. Despite complaints about his art style by long-time Legion of Super-Heroes fans - who felt his style was "too rough and unrefined", leading to more than one prominent critic to refer to him as "Ol' Scratchy" - Coipel continued to draw the series when it was relaunched under the new title The Legion.
</p><p>
Coipel signed an exclusive contract with Marvel Comics in January 2005. He was named in August 2005 as one of Marvel's "Young Guns," a group of artists that included Jim Cheung, David Finch, Trevor Hairsine, Adi Granov, and Steve McNiven, which according to Marvel Editor-in-Chief Joe Quesada, exhibited the qualities that make "a future superstar penciller."
