Arcade: The Comics Revue is a 7 issue magazine-sized comics anthology created and edited by cartoonists <a href="../ArtSpiegelman/ArtSpiegelman.html">Art Spiegelman</a> and <a href="../BillGriffith/BillGriffith.html">Bill Griffith</a> to showcase underground comix. Published quarterly by <a href="../PrintMint/PrintMint.html">the Print Mint</a>, it ran for seven issues between 1975 and 1976. Arriving late in the underground era, Arcade "was conceived as a 'comics magazine for adults' that would showcase the 'best of the old and the best of the new comics.'" Many observers credit it with paving the way for the Spiegelman-edited anthology <a href="../Raw/Raw.html">RAW!</a>, the flagship publication of the 1980s alternative comics movement.

Creators who contributed to the anthology include <a href="../RobertCrumb/RobertCrumb.html">Robert Crumb</a>, <a href="../KimDeitch/KimDeitch.html">Kim Deitch</a>, <a href="../JayKinney/JayKinney.html">Jay Kinney</a>, Aline Kominsky, <a href="../JayLynch/JayLynch.html">Jay Lynch</a>, <a href="../SpainRodriguez/SpainRodriguez.html">Spain Rodriguez</a>, <a href="../GilbertShelton/GilbertShelton.html">Gilbert Shelton</a>, S. Clay Wilson, Robert Armstrong, <a href="../JustinGreen/JustinGreen.html">Justin Green</a>, Michael McMillan, Diane Noomin. Crumb illustrated five of the seven front covers. Each issue contained a reprint of work by a cartoonist from the medium's Golden Age, including H. M. Bateman, Harrison Cady, Billy DeBeck, Milt Gross, and George McManus. Each issue's title page contained individual self-portraits by the contributors.

By the mid-1970s, the underground comix movement was encountering a slowdown, and Spiegelman and Griffith conceived of Arcade as a "safe berth." It stood out from similar publications by having an ambitious editorial plan, in which Spiegelman and Griffith attempted to show how comics connected to the broader realms of artistic and literary culture. Arcade also introduced comic strips from ages past, as well as contemporary literary pieces by writers such as William S. Burroughs and Charles Bukowski, and illustrated nonfiction pieces by writers like Paul Krassner and J. Hoberman.

Spiegelman and Griffith, based in the San Francisco Bay Area — the epicenter of the underground movement — launched Arcade in Spring 1975. Soon after, however, co-editor Spiegelman moved back to his original home of New York City, which put most of the editorial work for Arcade on the shoulders of Griffith and his cartoonist wife, Diane Noomin. This, combined with distribution problems, retailer indifference, and a general failure to find a devoted audience, led to the magazine's 1976 demise.
